  <objective>
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI, PET scan, and EUS performed as an add-on test or PET-CT as an add-on or replacement test to CT scanning in detecting curative resectability in pancreatic and periampullary cancer.
Secondary objectives
We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity.
Studies at low risk of bias versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011).
Full text publications versus abstracts (this can give a clue about publication bias since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status) (Eloubeidi 2001).
Prospective studies versus retrospective studies.
Proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer, ampullary cancer, and duodenal cancers (although classified as periampullary cancers they each have a different prognosis) (Klempnauer 1995). The additional value of the imaging modalities may be different because of the extent of spread in these different types of periampullary cancers.
Different definitions for resectable cancer on laparotomy. Different surgeons may consider cancer unresectable differently i.e. different surgeons would have different criteria for unresectability on laparotomy (other than the consensus criteria for resectability). For example, one surgeon may judge that the cancer is unresectable on laparotomy because of the involvement of the local vessels (mainly portal vein and superior mesenteric vein) and consider the reference standard to be positive. This would result in a false negative result for the imaging modality. Another surgeon may judge the same cancer to be resectable despite the involvement of the vessel and proceed with resection. The reference standard would be negative in this situation, which would result in a true negative result for the imaging modality. This might have an intrinsic threshold effect.
Additional pre-tests performed (besides CT scan). This can alter the pre-test probability of unresectability and can help in the assessment of the additional value of the imaging modality under various situations.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We only included studies that provided diagnostic test accuracy data (true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative) on the different imaging modalities mentioned above in the appropriate patient population (see below) irrespective of language, publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. However, we excluded case reports which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data. We also planned to exclude any identified case-control studies because case-control studies are prone to bias (Whiting 2011).</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Adults considered for curative resection of pancreatic or periampullary cancer on the basis of CT findings, who were fit to undergo major surgery. We included patients in this review irrespective of whether they underwent other imaging modalities prior to imaging modality being assessed.</participants>

  <target_conditions>
The target conditions were unresectable pancreatic and periampullary cancers, that is, we considered the imaging modality a positive test if the pancreatic or periampullary cancer is unresectable with curative intent. In these cancers it is not possible to perform curative resectability. Clinically, it may not be easy to distinguish head of pancreas cancers, ampullary cancers, and cancer of the second part of the duodenum. The treatment for these different cancers is the same, i.e. pancreatoduodenectomy and the final confirmation as to the origin of these cancers may be done after resection without definitive diagnosis of the origin of the cancer, as long as the cancers are resectable. So we considered these cancers together. There are no uniform criteria for resectability of pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Consensus exists for the definition of borderline resectable cancers (Abrams 2009). Therefore, where there is less tissue involvement than in a borderline resectable cancer the tumour can be considered as resectable. We accepted any criteria of resectability used by the study authors and acknowledge that this could potentially create a threshold effect. In general, the cancer will not be resected if liver, peritoneal, or distal nodal metastases were noted, or if the cancer had invaded important adjacent blood vessels that are beyond the criteria for borderline resectable cancers (for example, greater than 180Â° involvement of the superior mesenteric artery) (Abrams 2009).</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Confirmation of liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic involvement by histopathological examination of suspicious (liver, peritoneal, or nodal metastatic) lesions obtained at diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy. We accepted only paraffin section histology as the reference standard. In clinical practice, depending on the urgency of the results, a frozen section biopsy may be done to obtain immediate results. However, this is always confirmed by subsequent paraffin section histology (which can take several days) because frozen section biopsy is not as reliable as paraffin section histology. We also accepted the surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy when biopsy confirmation was not possible as an alternate reference standard. For example, if the tumour has invaded the adjacent blood vessels the surgeon may not resect the tumour because of the danger posed by resecting part of a large blood vessel, and so biopsy confirmation cannot be obtained. However, it should be noted that a surgeon's judgement of unresectability at laparotomy is a subjective decision and is a possible source of error in the reference standard. In the absence of an ethical and true gold standard, we accepted this as a reference standard.</reference_standards>
