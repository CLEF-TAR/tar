  <objective>
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia.
Secondary objectives
To assess the influence of potential sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We investigated the use of other laboratory investigations (such as culture and PCR) alongside serology to diagnose M. pneumoniae.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
Published peer-reviewed studies (any design) including prospectively and consecutively recruited cohorts of children with community-acquired pneumonia in any healthcare setting.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
 aged 18 years or younger with no evidence of serious underlying comorbidity (e.g. cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, neoplasia) or immunocompromise (HIV-positive or on immunosuppressant medication), who have been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical +/- radiological criteria.</participants>
