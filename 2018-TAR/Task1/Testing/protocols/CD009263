We reviewed three index test combinations: 1. ¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy, 2. 18F-FDG-PET(-CT), and 3. ¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy plus 18F-FDG-PET(-CT). See Figure 1: flowchart of index tests.

Flow chart index tests in patients with suspected neuroblastoma.
Primary objective 
1.1 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old.
1.2 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of negative ¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy in combination with 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old. In this case 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) is an add-on test.
Secondary objectives
2.1 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old.
2.2 To compare the diagnostic accuracy of ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy and of 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging for detecting a neuroblastoma and its metastases at first diagnosis or at recurrence in children from 0 to 18 years old. This was performed within and between (objective 1.1 compared to objective 2.1) included studies. ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy was the comparator test in this case.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
When assessing study results, we considered methodological and clinical sources of heterogeneity as well as variation in the criteria used to define a positive test result. Several factors may contribute to heterogeneity in diagnostic performance across studies. We investigated, where possible, the potential influence of differences in the following items:
Study population:
Newly diagnosed versus recurrent neuroblastoma.
Stage of disease (1 to 4 and 4S) as an ordinal variable. We reported stage 1 and 2 combined and stage 3, 4 and 4S separately.
Index test radio labelled MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy:
Time span between injection and scanning (24 or 48 hours) (acquisition time).
WB scan versus SPECT-CT.
Interfering medication (Table 3).
Reference standard:
Type of test: histopathology (reference test 1) versus bone marrow aspirate or trephine biopsy (reference test 2) versus histopathology in combination with excretion of catecholamines in the urine and additional imaging modalities (reference test 3).</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included primary diagnostic studies if they compared the results of ¹²³I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy, 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging, or both, with the tests described as reference standards (as defined below) and if they compared the results of both tests with each other. Studies needed to be of a cross-sectional design or a case series of proven neuroblastoma. Patient selection could be either retrospective or prospective. We excluded case reports, studies that described fewer than ten patients suspected for neuroblastoma and diagnostic case-control studies.
Studies had to report sufficient data to construct (part of) a two-by-two table, i.e. at least the absolute number of true positives and false negatives had to be available from the data reported in the primary studies or obtainable from the study authors to calculate the sensitivity and if possible the specificity. ¹²³I-MIBG scintigraphy is only performed when there is a high suspicion of a neuroblastoma based on clinical information, excretion of catecholamines in the urine and different imaging methods. Therefore, it is expected that mainly the outcome of MIBG scans in patients with finally proven neuroblastoma will be reported and that thus often only sensitivity can be analysed.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Children from 0 to 18 years old with suspected neuroblastoma and its metastases of any stage at first diagnosis or at recurrence in a tertiary care centre of paediatric oncology. We excluded studies on animals, studies not performed in children with suspected neuroblastoma, studies performed in children with esthesioneuroblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma, and studies on the therapeutic use of MIBG.</participants>
