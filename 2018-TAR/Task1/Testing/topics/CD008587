Title: Cytology versus HPV testing for cervical cancer screening in the general population 

Objective: The main objective of this review was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of HPV testing for detecting histologically confirmed CIN 2 or worse (CIN 2+), including adenocarcinoma in situ, in women participating in primary cervical cancer screening; and how it compares to the accuracy of cytological testing (liquid-based and conventional) at various thresholds.
