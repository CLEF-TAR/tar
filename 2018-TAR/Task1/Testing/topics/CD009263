Title: 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and 18F-FDG-PET imaging for diagnosing neuroblastoma 

Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 123I-MIBG (SPECT-CT) scintigraphy for detecting a primary or recurrent neuroblastoma tumour and its metastases in children from 0 to 18 years old.To determine the diagnostic accuracy of negative 123I-MIBG scintigraphy in combination with 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) imaging for detecting a primary or recurrent neuroblastoma tumour and its metastases in children from 0 to 18 years old. In this case 18F-FDG-PET(-CT) is an add-on test.
