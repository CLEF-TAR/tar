  <objective>
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of pulse oximetry as a screening method for detection of CCHD in asymptomatic newborn infants
Secondary objectives
To assess potential sources of heterogeneity, including:
characteristics of the population: inclusion or exclusion of antenatally detected congenital heart defects;
timing of testing: &lt; 24 hours versus ≥ 24 hours after birth;
site of testing: right hand and foot (pre-ductal and post-ductal) versus foot only (post-ductal);
oxygen saturation: functional versus fractional;
study design: retrospective versus prospective design, consecutive versus non-consecutive series; and
risk of bias for the "flow and timing" domain of QUADAS-2.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We considered inclusion of prospective or retrospective cohort and cross-sectional studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of pulse oximetry as a screening method for detection of critical congenital heart defects in asymptomatic newborn infants. A study of diagnostic accuracy should provide sufficient data for construction of the two-by-two table showing the cross-classification of disease status (CCHD) and test outcome (pulse oximetry). We excluded studies if we could not extract true-positive (TP), true-negative (TN), false-positive (FP), and false-negative (FN) values after contacting corresponding authors of primary studies when necessary. We excluded case reports and studies of case-control design.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
We included studies that recruited asymptomatic (with no signs of respiratory or cardiac illness) term or near-term newborns before discharge from hospital.</participants>
  <index_tests>
The test under evaluation was pulse oximetry screening to identify low oxygen saturation. We included all protocols of screening (eg, post-ductal [foot] only vs pre-ductal and post-ductal [right hand and foot], different saturation thresholds to define abnormality, different numbers of repeat tests). Criteria for defining a screen as positive or negative in this review were those used by the authors of respective publications.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Critical congenital heart defects as defined above.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
 Reference were diagnostic echocardiography (echocardiogram) and clinical follow-up in the first 28 days of life, including postmortem findings and information from mortality and congenital anomaly databases, to identify patients with false-negative findings.</reference_standards>
