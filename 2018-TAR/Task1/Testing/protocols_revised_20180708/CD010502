  <objective>
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of RADTs for diagnosing GAS in children with pharyngitis. To assess the relative diagnostic accuracy of the two major types of RADTs (enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and optical immunoassays (OIA)) by indirect and direct comparison.
Secondary objectives
To assess the relative diagnostic accuracy of EIA and OIA tests by indirect and direct comparison.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included reports of cross-sectional studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of one or more RADTs for the diagnosis of GAS in children with pharyngitis, with laboratory throat culture as the reference standard. Reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also eligible if we could extract 2 x 2 tables for children. Reports of studies in which throat culture was selectively performed in participants with a positive or negative RADT result were included in the review but excluded from the meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity estimates.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
We included reports of studies of children (age â‰¤ 21 years, according to the upper limit used by the American Academy of Pediatrics) seeking ambulatory medical care because of a sore throat or with a diagnosis of pharyngitis, who provided a throat swab for a RADT and laboratory throat culture. In this review, ambulatory care settings included private physicians' offices (general practitioners and paediatricians), walk-in clinics, hospital outpatient clinics, emergency departments and family medicine centres; we excluded studies performed by specialised physicians (e.g., ear, nose and throat specialists).
We also included reports of studies with only a subgroup of participants eligible for inclusion in the review, provided that we could extract relevant data specific to that subgroup. Reports of studies were not excluded on the basis of whether studies were performed in high-income or low-income countries because no data exist to support variations in the accuracy of RADTs according to this criterion.</participants>
  <index_tests>
We included only studies of EIA or OIA RADTs for GAS in children with pharyngitis, including those no longer marketed.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
GAS in children with pharyngitis (dichotomous).</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Studies were required to diagnose GAS with throat culture on a blood agar plate in a microbiology laboratory used as the reference test. Several parameters may affect the accuracy of throat culture. For studies involving more than one throat culture technique (different medium, duration or atmosphere of incubation), we a priori chose to extract data related to the culture technique recommended by a panel of North American content experts, i.e., simple blood agar plate (versus selective or enriched media), incubation 48 hours total (versus 18 to 24 hours only), aerobic atmosphere (versus other) (Shulman 2000), in order to avoid data-driven approaches.</reference_standards>
