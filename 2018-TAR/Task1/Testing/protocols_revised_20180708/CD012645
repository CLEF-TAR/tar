  <objective>
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, procalcitonin, or LDH, either alone or in combination, in the diagnosis of necrotising pancreatitis in people with acute pancreatitis and without organ failure.
Secondary objectives
We planned to explore the following sources of heterogeneity.
Studies at low risk of bias versus those at unclear or high risk of bias (as assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool, recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group) (Whiting 2006; Whiting 2011).
Prospective studies versus retrospective studies (to determine whether there is a difference in diagnostic accuracy between prospective and retrospective studies).
Full-text publications versus abstracts (this can be indicative of publication bias, since there may be an association between the results of the study and the study reaching full publication status) (Eloubeidi 2001).
Previous history of acute pancreatitis.
Different aetiology for acute pancreatitis (gallstone versus alcohol versus other aetiology). The accuracy of the test may depend upon the aetiology of the acute pancreatitis.
Presence or absence of infection. The accuracy of the test may depend upon the presence or absence of infection.
Pancreatic versus peripancreatic necrosis.
Average time to performance of the test. The accuracy of the test may depend upon the interval between the onset of clinical symptoms and the performance of the test.
Different test manufacturers.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included studies that evaluated the accuracy of the index tests mentioned above in the appropriate population (see below). We included relevant studies irrespective of language or publication status; whether the data were collected prospectively or retrospectively; and whether there was a comparison between the tests. However, we excluded case reports (which describe how the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or acute necrotising pancreatitis was made on an individual participant or a group of participants and which do not provide sufficient diagnostic test accuracy data, i.e. true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative). We also planned to exclude case-control studies because they are prone to bias (Whiting 2011); however, we did not identify any case-control studies.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Adult participants with acute pancreatitis within 14 days of the onset of symptoms (irrespective of the interval between the onset of symptoms and the time at which the test was performed). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should have been made on the basis of the consensus conference definition (Banks 2013).  who had already developed organ failure at the time of performing these tests were excluded, since all such participants undergo radiological investigations. Although we had planned to exclude participants in whom pancreatic necrosis was present on the CT scan used to diagnose acute pancreatitis, this information was not available from the studies.</participants>
  <index_tests>
Serum CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH either alone or in combination immediately prior to radiological investigation. A variety of kits are available for measuring these tests. We included kits from all manufacturers, and included studies irrespective of the threshold used. We included studies that reported a single test and sequential tests of serum CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH. If the study reported sequential testing, we planned to consider a progressive increase as a positive index test irrespective of the degree of increase, and stationary or decrease in the levels as a negative test; however, none of the studies reported this information despite measuring the levels on different days.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Pancreatic necrosis (i.e. infected or sterile pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis)</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
While considered to be the gold standard for confirming necrosis, biopsy may not have been performed in all participants due to ethical concerns over performing an invasive treatment (during which biopsy is taken) in those without a diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. As a result, study authors may use radiological features of pancreatic necrosis (an area of reduced enhancement or non-enhancing area of pancreatic parenchyma on CECT or contrast-enhanced MRI). However, this reference standard may miss some cases of pancreatic necrosis, resulting in underestimation of diagnostic test accuracy of the index tests. In addition, using radiological features of pancreatitis might introduce an intrinsic threshold effect because of interobserver variation between radiologists. As per protocol, we accepted any of the following reference standards, used alone or in combination: radiological features of pancreatic necrosis (CECT or contrast-enhanced MRI) or histological confirmation of pancreatic necrosis. We also included a combination of radiological features of pancreatic necrosis (CECT or contrast-enhanced MRI) and surgeon's judgement of pancreatic necrosis during surgery, as we considered this equivalent to radiologist judgement of the presence of pancreatic necrosis on CECT or contrast-enhanced MRI. In terms of ranking the reference standards, we considered biopsy in all participants as the best reference standard (although it is unlikely to be performed in participants with a negative test for pancreatic necrosis) followed by biopsy in participants with positive test and radiological or surgical features of pancreatic necrosis in participants with negative test, and radiological tests or surgery alone as the reference standard, in that order.</reference_standards>
