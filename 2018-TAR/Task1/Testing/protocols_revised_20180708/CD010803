  <objective>
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of 1) CSF t-tau, 2) CSF p-tau, 3) the CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio and 4) the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio index tests for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia at follow-up.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the amount and associations of heterogeneity in the included studies of test accuracy.
We expected heterogeneity to be an important component of the review. We planned to use target population, index test, target disorder and study quality as a framework for the investigation of heterogeneity.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We considered longitudinal cohort studies in which index test results were obtained at baseline and the reference standard results at follow-up (see Index tests; Reference standards). These studies necessarily employ delayed verification of conversion to dementia and are sometimes labelled as ‘delayed verification cross-sectional studies’ (Bossuyt 2008,; Knottnerus 2002). This approach recognises the challenges of concurrent application of the reference test and index test. In reality, the reference standard for dementia is tissue sampling and histological examination, either at post mortem or from brain biopsy. Brain biopsy is not undertaken in any setting and a post mortem is so distant an event from the index test being conducted that there is the possibility that disease may have developed in the years after the index test. The Dementia DTA group chose to use later diagnosis of dementia (using standardised criteria) as evidence of delayed verification. This methodology has been published by our group (Mason 2010) and also reflects the approach taken in most of the primary research in this area.
We included nested case-control studies if they incorporated a delayed verification design. We believe this can only occur in the context of a cohort study, so these studies are invariably diagnostic nested cohort studies. We only included data on performance of the index test to discriminate between people with MCI who converted to dementia and those who remained stable from those studies. We did not consider data from healthy controls or any other control group.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
 Participants recruited and clinically classified as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline were eligible for inclusion in this review.  The diagnosis for MCI was established using the Petersen criteria or revised Petersen criteria (Petersen 1999; Petersen 2004; Winbald 2004) and/or Matthews criteria (Matthews 2008) and/or 'CDR = 0.5' (Morris 1993). These criteria include: subjective complaints; a decline in memory objectively verified by neuropsychological testing in combination with a history from the patient; a decline in other cognitive domains; no or minimal impairment of activities of daily living; and not meeting the criteria for dementia. Therefore, the eligible participants had a number of tests, e.g. neuropsychological tests for cognitive deficit and checklists for activities of daily living, before study entry.  were defined either as amnestic single domain, amnestic multiple domain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multiple domain, or nonspecified MCI participants.
We included participants from secondary and tertiary settings. Although demographic and clinical characteristics of MCI, as well as sources of recruitment, might differ in those settings, we decided not to limit our review by setting; instead, we planned to look for variation within and between settings, and examined the potential influence of the setting on diagnostic performance of the index test in the analyses.
We excluded those studies that included people with MCI possibly caused by: i) a current or history of alcohol/drug abuse; ii) central nervous system (CNS) trauma (e.g. subdural haematoma), tumour, or infection; iii) other neurological conditions, e.g. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases.
Because detail of the causes of study dropouts is crucial, and, if such data are missing, the reliability of the conclusions must be questioned, we planned to take this into consideration.</participants>
  <index_tests>
Studies that assessed the accuracy of CSF measurements of CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio, or CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio were included.
There are currently no generally accepted standards for the plasma or CSF ABeta test threshold, and therefore it was not possible to prespecify what constituted a positive or negative result. We used the criteria which were applied in each included primary study to classify participants as either test positive or test negative.
Measure of index test: t-tau and p-tau and ABeta level in CSF (ng.l-1 or pg.ml-1)
The assays most commonly used were conventional Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium kit or INNOTEST Phospho-Tau(181) kit or INNOTEST ABeta42 or INNOTEST the multiplexing INNO-BIA AlzBio3 for CSF.
We did not include a comparator test because there are currently no standard practice tests available for the diagnosis of dementia. We compared the index tests with a reference standard.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
There were two target conditions in this review:
Alzheimer’s disease dementia (conversion from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia)
Any other forms of dementia (conversion from MCI to any other forms of dementia)</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
For the purpose of this review, several definitions of Alzheimer’s disease dementia were acceptable. Included studies could apply probable or possible NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) criteria (McKhann 1984). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (World Health Organization 2010) definitions for Alzheimer’s disease dementia were also acceptable. It should be noted that different iterations of these standards may not be directly comparable over time (e.g. DSM-IIIR versus DSM-IV). Moreover, the validity of the diagnoses may vary with the degree or manner in which the criteria have been operationalised (e.g. individual clinician versus algorithm versus consensus determination). We planned to consider all these issues in interpreting the results, using sensitivity analyses as appropriate.
Similarly, differing clinical definitions of other forms of dementias were acceptable.  For Lewy body dementia, the reference standard is the McKeith criteria (McKeith 1996; McKeith 2005). For frontotemporal dementia, the reference standard is the Lund criteria (LMG 1994, Neary 1998, Boxer 2005). DSM (DSMIII 1987; DSMIV 1994) and ICD (World Health Organization 2010) were also acceptable for frontotemporal and vascular dementias.
The time interval over which progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia or other forms of dementia happened is also important. As age is the principal risk factor for Alzheimer's dementia and other forms of dementias, the longer the duration of follow-up, the more likely the possibility of generating false positive findings for the index test. To this end, no limits were put on the length of follow-up in the included studies, though this important variable was captured so we could examine between-study variations. This change reflected an alteration to the original thinking in the published protocol and is noted in the Differences between protocol and review section of this review.
We planned to segment analyses into separate follow-up periods for the delay in verification: less than one year, one year to less than two years; two to less than four years; and more than four years. </reference_standards>
