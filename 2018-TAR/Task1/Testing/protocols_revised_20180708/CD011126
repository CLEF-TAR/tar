Primary objectives
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test.
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) compared with 2D SIS for the diagnosis of focally growing lesions (presence or not) in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy performed as the reference test. In this case, any abnormality on either modality was regarded as a positive result (‘OR’ approach).
Secondary objectives
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS (index test 1) compared with 2D SIS according to type of abnormality and discrimination between uterine polyps and submucous fibroids in women with AUB or subfertility, with hysteroscopy and histology used as the reference.

  <type_of_study>
All diagnostic test accuracy studies, randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies for which a 2×2 contingency table could be reproduced in which 2D SIS and 3D SIS were evaluated with results of hysteroscopy as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion in the review. All studies in which 2D SIS or 3D SIS alone was evaluated were considered eligible for inclusion, although if enough studies (10) were found, we preferred studies that reported both 2D SIS and 3D SIS. We included comparative studies if both 2D SIS and 3D SIS were performed in the same setting, regardless of performance sequence, to avoid a difference in performance between index tests arising from differences among participants and settings. We excluded case control, case report and retrospective cohort studies. We contacted the authors of unpublished studies (only congress abstract or published protocol was available) to facilitate inclusion of additional useful data. We did not apply language restrictions.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Populations of interest were premenopausal women with AUB or subfertility and postmenopausal women with AUB.</participants>
  <index_tests>
We included studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of 3D SIS alone (index test 1) or 2D+3D SIS (index test 2) versus 2D SIS (comparator test). We defined SIS as positive for a focal intrauterine lesion when any distortion of the endometrial lining was visualised (see below). We preferred that time between index test and reference standard was less than one month.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
The target condition was the presence (or absence) of a focally growing lesion in the uterine cavity (endometrial polyp, submucous fibroid). We differentiated between polyps and fibroids by classifying smoothly margined echogenic masses with a homogenous texture as polyps (Parsons 1993), and well-defined round lesions within the myometrium or attached to it, often showing shadows at the edge of the lesion and/or internal fan-shaped shadowing, as uterine fibroids (van den Bosch 2015a). Typically, echogenicity varies and some hyperechogenicity may be present internally. We classified submucous fibroids into types of fibroid (types 0 to 2) using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) PALM-COEIN classification for abnormal uterine bleeding: type 0 = pedunculated intracavitary, 1 = submucosal &lt; 50% intramural, 2 = submucosal ≥ 50% intramural (Munro 2011). We did not consider hyperplasia, adhesions and congenital anomalies as focally growing lesions.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Diagnostic hysteroscopy was the reference standard for confirmation of the absence or presence of the target condition. Absence of an intracavitary abnormality was seen as clear vision of the entire cavity without disruption of the endometrial lining. When reported, we also used histology as a reference standard to differentiate the type of abnormality (polyp or fibroid). Because the sensitivity for 2D SIS is known to be high (de Kroon 2003), it might be considered unethical to perform hysteroscopy in women with a negative SIS test (meaning no suspicion of abnormality). To optimise data quantity, we included data from studies with partial verification bias (i.e. when some women did not undergo a hysteroscopy (reference standard) after a negative test result with 2D SIS).</reference_standards>
