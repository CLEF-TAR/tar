  <objective>
To assess from the current literature the sensitivity of CT cerebral angiography as an additional confirmatory test for diagnosing death using neurological criteria, following satisfaction of clinical neurological criteria for brain death.
Secondary objectives
No secondary objective was examined.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included studies of patient populations, published in all languages. If relevant non-English articles were identified but full-text translations could not be obtained in press, we placed them in the 'Studies awaiting assessment' section and sought help from colleagues within The Cochrane Collaboration to obtain accurate translations.
We considered studies to be acceptable if:
the studies compared cerebral CTA (with or without other imaging or ancillary tests) with a clinical diagnosis of brain death, that is satisfaction of accepted clinical neurological criteria to diagnose death;
the participant population was defined as those in whom either a clinical diagnosis of brain death had already been made or a clinical diagnosis of brain death was established as part of the study;
the absolute numbers of true and false positives, and true and false negatives, were either available directly from the published study data, secondarily derivable from data within the published study or as supplementary published material, or available directly from the original study authors. Although at the outset we sought to collect data regarding numbers of true negatives and false positives from studies, it rapidly became apparent from a preliminary review of the literature that all but one of the published studies included no control group.
Other comparator tests were not reviewed as part of this study. We anticipated that many studies would include at least one other imaging or investigative comparator test; if these studies fulfilled our criteria for acceptance they were included.  
In some studies, cerebral CTA may have been considered as a reference test and a further clinical test compared against it. Our search strategy was tailored to include these studies, however they were not included unless they provided a statement to the effect that 'all included patients satisfied a clinical diagnosis of brain death', or similar, allowing cerebral CTA to be viewed as an index test against the reference test of clinical testing. We planned to contact authors of any such studies to obtain relevant supplementary data.
Studies ideally defined clinical and imaging variables that were employed as part of their methodology. In particular, if details of the following were not specifically included we contacted the author(s) for further details.</type_of_study>
  <participants>We included patients in whom a diagnosis of brain death was suspected or in whom a clinical diagnosis of brain death had been made. We identified both adult and paediatric populations; this is consistent with the recommendations of the working party of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges 2008 that standard adult clinical criteria and testing can be used in those over two months of age to diagnose brain death. However, there are several physiological and procedural differences in the performance of CTA in the paediatric population, namely the volume of contrast administered (which is related to weight) and cardiac output. These factors may significantly affect the utility of CTA in the paediatric population and, therefore, we planned to analyse data for adult (over 16 years) and paediatric populations separately. No paediatric data were identified.</participants>
  <index_tests>The index test was cerebral CTA. Image acquisition and reporting variables were defined as listed above.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>The target condition was the clinical diagnosis of brain death. Included studies needed to define the clinical method used to establish a diagnosis of brain death.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>The reference standard was the diagnosis of brain death, which is in effect the same as the target condition.
In order to reduce heterogeneity, we recorded the clinical method used to diagnose brain death. We contacted authors or established the legal requirements in the country of article authorship, or both, to establish this. We originally considered performing subgroup analysis between cohorts diagnosed according to a 'no brainstem function' clinical method and those diagnosed according to a 'no brain or brainstem function' clinical method, but subsequent paucity of data precluded this possibility.</reference_standards>
