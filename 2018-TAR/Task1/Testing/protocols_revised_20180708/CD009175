  <objective>
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia.
Secondary objectives
To assess the influence of potential sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs in the clinical recognition of M. pneumoniae in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We investigated the use of other laboratory investigations (such as culture and PCR) alongside serology to diagnose M. pneumoniae.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
Published peer-reviewed studies (any design) including prospectively and consecutively recruited cohorts of children with community-acquired pneumonia in any healthcare setting.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
 Participants aged 18 years or younger with no evidence of serious underlying comorbidity (e.g. cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, neoplasia) or immunocompromise (HIV-positive or on immunosuppressant medication), who have been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical +/- radiological criteria.</participants>
  <index_tests>
Clinical symptoms and signs reported in children and adolescents diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia: cough, wheeze, coryza (nasal symptoms, including runny nose, nasal congestion and sneezing), crepitations (crackles audible on chest examination), fever (reported as a symptom or according to temperature threshold defined in study), rhonchi (wheeze audible on chest examination), shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, myalgia (muscle aches) and headache.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>M. pneumoniae infection in children and adolescents with community-acquired pneumonia.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>Our reference standard was M. pneumoniae serology with or without the use of additional laboratory tests such as culture or PCR. M. pneumoniae serology is currently the most widely available diagnostic method. We defined a positive M. pneumoniae serology result as either a high antibody titre on a single serum sample or a significant rise in antibody titre between paired acute and convalescent sera, as defined by the manufacturers of the serology assay(s) being used in different studies.</reference_standards>
