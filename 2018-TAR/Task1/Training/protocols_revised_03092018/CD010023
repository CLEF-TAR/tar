  <objective>
The primary aim of this study is to identify the most suitable diagnostic imaging strategy for identifying clinically suspected fractures of the scaphoid bone in patients with normal radiographs. Therefore we looked at the diagnostic performance characteristics (Appendix 1) of the most used imaging modalities for this purpose: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy.
Secondary objectives
To investigate which imaging technique is the best for determining the location of the fracture (proximal, waist or distal).
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We assessed the potential influence of sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of the tests, especially the type of reference standard and blinded evaluation of the reference test (if reported).</objective>
  <type_of_study>
All prospective or retrospective studies involving a consecutive series of patients. We only included trials using reference standards that we considered optimal or adequate. Randomised controlled trials would have been included if these had been found.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
People of all ages who presented at hospital or clinic within one week of trauma with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and negative post-trauma radiographs. Clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture is based on pain in the anatomical snuffbox or by longitudinal compression of the thumb, or both. The radiographs generally include two images of the wrist (postero-anterior and lateral views) and at least one of two additional scaphoid views.</participants>
  <index_tests>
CT, MRI or BS, or a combination of two of these tests. Because the criteria for a fracture may differ (especially in MRI), we report all study characteristics, including 'fracture criteria', in Characteristics of included studies.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Clinically suspected scaphoid fractures (which could be proximal, waist or distal) with negative plain radiographs.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Various reference standards were included.
A scaphoid plain radiograph series, conducted six to 14 weeks after the initial injury, consisting of the following four views: posteroanterior with the wrist in neutral position; lateral; semipronated oblique scaphoid; and radial oblique scaphoid. An abnormal lucent line within the scaphoid is considered evidence of a fracture.
The use of two index tests. If both are positive or negative, a final diagnosis is obtained.
In addition, clinical findings are often combined with an index test or repeated radiographs obtained after six weeks to formulate a reference standard.
The use of only one of the second-line modalities has been described; this is somewhat unsatisfactory because these diagnostic techniques are still under study. 
We considered six-week follow-up radiographs (1) the most suitable reference standard. Next we considered the use of two index tests with the same outcome and one index test including clinical findings (2 and 3). Although we considered the fourth option to be suboptimal, it was included in the review.
We did not include studies using clinical findings only six to 14 weeks after trauma or the single use of one- to two-week follow-up radiographs as a reference standard as we consider these inadequate.</reference_standards>
