  <objective>
This review aims to provide information on the diagnostic accuracy of tests used to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP or lumbar spine examination. Specifically, the review aims to assess the performance of information collected during the history taking or physical assessment (potential red flags). Such information will assist clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate management course in patients with LBP.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
Where feasible, the review will assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of red flags used to screen for vertebral fracture. In particular the influences of study design (e.g. consecutive series or case-control), healthcare setting (e.g. primary or secondary care), and aspects of study methods as reflected in the items of the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) checklist (Appendix 1), will be assessed.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We considered primary diagnostic studies if they compared the results of history taking or physical examination, to identify vertebral fracture in patients with LBP, to those of a reference standard. Cohort and cross-sectional studies of a consecutive series of patients, as well as case-control studies, that present sufficient data to allow estimates of diagnostic accuracy (such as sensitivity and specificity) were considered for eligibility in this review. Studies reported in abstracts or conference proceedings and full journal publications, in all languages were considered. Appropriate translation was sought when required.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Studies evaluating adult patients presenting to care for treatment of LBP or for lumbar spine examination were eligible. Studies with a substantial proportion of recruited patients (&gt; 10%) already diagnosed with vertebral fracture as the likely cause of LBP were excluded. Patients presenting to primary, secondary and tertiary care settings were included in this review. Results of studies carried out in different settings are clearly labelled in text and tables.</participants>
  <index_tests>
Studies investigating any aspect of the history taking or physical examination of LBP were considered eligible for inclusion. Such information included demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender), clinical and medical history (e.g. pain intensity, previous history of falls), and physical examination results (e.g. tenderness, reduced range of motion). Studies where diagnostic accuracy of individual red flags were evaluated in isolation or as part of a combination were included, however, combination red flags required clear description of which tests were involved. "Clinical diagnosis" or "global clinician judgement" (involving some unknown combination of history and physical examination) were excluded as a clinical judgement based on undefined parameters is difficult to interpret or generalise.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Studies that investigated patients presenting with LBP or for lumbar spine examination, and reported the prevalence of vertebral fracture were included.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Studies were included if red flags were compared with diagnostic imaging procedures such as plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scans to confirm the presence of vertebral fracture. Clinical follow-up was also considered suitable if suspected fracture was confirmed with imaging.</reference_standards>
