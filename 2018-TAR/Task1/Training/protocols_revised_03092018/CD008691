  <objective>
We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive cardiac screening tests versus coronary angiography in potential kidney transplant recipients. We provided summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy for individual index tests to better understand the utility and limitations of these non-invasive tests.
Secondary objectives
We compared the diagnostic accuracy among different screening tests through:
Direct comparison: By analysing the results of studies that assessed diagnostic accuracy of two or more tests in the same population head-to-head.
Indirect comparison: By comparing the pooled results of studies that assessed accuracy of screening tests in separate populations. 
The ability of screening tests to detect severe coronary artery stenosis (≥ 70% stenosis detected on coronary angiography) was also assessed and compared among different screening tests. 
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We also investigated if diagnostic accuracy varied among studies with different prevalence of symptomatic chest pain and analysed the effect. For this analysis, we included only studies that used a threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography for the diagnosis of CAD. To avoid partial verification, we considered effects among study participants who underwent both the index test and coronary angiography. This methodology meant that we were able to avoid partial verification.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included all diagnostic cross sectional studies, cohort studies and randomised studies of test accuracy that compared cardiac test accuracy with results obtained from coronary angiography (the reference standard). </type_of_study>
  <participants>
Study participants included all patients who were considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time the diagnostic tests were performed. 
Inclusion criteria
We included studies reporting outcomes relating to patients considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time diagnostic tests were performed. To ensure that our review was accessible and succinct, we chose to limit the population to patients with CKD who were considered candidates for kidney transplantation, but included all possible tests used to diagnose CAD.
Exclusion criteria
Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly state that all study participants were candidates for kidney transplantation. We also excluded studies that investigated cardiac test accuracy in patients with ESKD who were not transplant candidates (i.e. they were unselected dialysis patients, not undergoing pre-transplant assessment). Patients with ESKD who are not transplantation candidates differ from patients who are transplant candidates with respect to several key prognostic variables, such as age and fitness for surgery. These differences in the key prognostic variables may result in differences in disease prevalence and test performance. We also excluded studies which investigated patients with features of acute coronary syndrome as our aim was to investigate the performance of cardiac tests in a preoperative screening context. Where it appeared that only some of the study participants were transplantation candidates, we contacted the study authors requesting separate data for only transplantation candidates.</participants>

This compares perfusion of myocardium at rest and after a ‘stress’ such as exercise or drugs (e.g. dipyridamole). 

When coronary arteries are normal, ‘stress’ results in vasodilatation and increased coronary blood flow. However, diseased coronary arteries cannot dilate because they are already maximally dilated and there is no increase in blood flow after a stress. MPS reveals these areas as regions of decreased perfusion. A reversible perfusion defect is a sign of ischaemia. A fixed defect (when there is decreased perfusion before, during and after the stress) is an indicator of infarction.

DSE

Stress 
Exercise

Exercise ECG

Bruce protocol stress ECG
Patient exercises on a treadmill while connected to an ECG. The level of exercise is increased in progressive stages. The patient's symptoms and blood pressure response are checked repeatedly. Ischaemic ECG changes or angina symptoms brought on by exercise are highly suggestive of underlying CAD

Often limited by the inability of CKD patients to achieve an adequate peak exercise workload, development of exercise‐induced hypotension

High proportion have abnormal baseline ECG (left ventricular hypertrophy)
Dichotomous (i.e. stress test positive or stress test negative)
No. However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation
Coronary artery calcium score

EBCT 
Multidetector computed tomography
Cardiac calcium scoring is a non‐invasive test that uses computed tomography to detect the presence of calcium in plaque on the walls of the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries). A calcium score is then derived, calculated as a summation of all calcified lesions in the coronary arteries. The calcium score is then compared with a reference range appropriate to a patient's age and sex. High calcium scores are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular events
Non‐invasive
Neither 100% sensitive nor specific

Continuous
There is no uniformly agreed cut‐off value at which patients are considered at high risk of CAD. We planned to analyse results by combining data from studies which share identical cut‐off values

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Evaluates both cardiac and pulmonary function. Cardiac function is evaluated in terms of aerobic capacity and respiratory function.
