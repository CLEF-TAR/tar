  <objective>
The objective of this systematic review is to assess the diagnostic performance of clinical characteristics ("red flags") identified by taking a clinical history and conducting a physical examination to screen for spinal malignancy in patients presenting with LBP, as assessed by diagnostic imaging. This information may assist clinicians to make decisions about appropriate management in patients with LBP.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
The secondary objective of this review is to assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of "red flags" for spinal malignancy. We aim to examine the influence of the healthcare setting (e.g. primary or secondary care), the study design (e.g. consecutive series or case-control), and aspects of study quality as reflected in the assessment of the items of the QUADAS checklist.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
Primary diagnostic studies were considered if they compared the results of taking a history and completing a physical examination for the identification of spinal malignancy in patients with LBP, with those of a reference standard. The main focus of the review was on studies using a cross-sectional or prospective design which present sufficient data to allow calculation of estimates of diagnostic accuracy (such as sensitivity and specificity), which are reported in full publications. Case-control studies were also considered if insufficient primary diagnostic studies were identified. If studies were reported in abstracts or conference proceedings, we retrieved the full publications where possible. Studies published in all languages were included in this review. Where necessary, appropriate translation of potentially eligible articles was sought.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Studies were included if they evaluated adult patients who presented to primary or secondary care settings for treatment of LBP or for lumbar spine examination. Longitudinal studies in which more than 10% of recruited patients had already been diagnosed with spinal malignancy as the likely cause of their LBP were excluded. This proportion was chosen based on a consensus among the review team, in an attempt to minimise referral bias.</participants>
  <index_tests>
Studies evaluating any aspects of the history taking or physical examination of patients with LBP were eligible for inclusion. This included demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender), the clinical history (e.g. pain intensity or a previous history of cancer), and results of the physical examination (e.g. tenderness/pain on palpation, lumbar range of motion, or muscle strength). Studies were included if the diagnostic accuracy of the individual "red flags" were evaluated in isolation, or as part of a combination. Studies in which only a "clinical diagnosis" or "global clinician judgment" (without specifying which diagnostic tools were used) were compared with a reference standard were excluded from this review. An undefined clinical judgment represents an individual clinician's diagnostic ability, rather than providing useful data on clearly defined patient characteristics.</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
All studies that reported results of the history taking or physical examination in detecting spinal malignancy in patients who presented for management of LBP were included. Where possible, we described separate results for primary tumours and secondary metastases.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
Studies were included if "red flags" were compared with diagnostic imaging procedures such as plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scans to confirm the presence of cancer or malignancy in the spine. Long-term (&gt; six months) follow-up of patients after the initial consultation was also considered an appropriate reference standard, if suspected cases of malignancy were confirmed by medical records or specialist review.</reference_standards>
