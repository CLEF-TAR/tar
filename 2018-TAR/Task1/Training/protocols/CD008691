  <objective>
We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive cardiac screening tests versus coronary angiography in potential kidney transplant recipients. We provided summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy for individual index tests to better understand the utility and limitations of these non-invasive tests.
Secondary objectives
We compared the diagnostic accuracy among different screening tests through:
Direct comparison: By analysing the results of studies that assessed diagnostic accuracy of two or more tests in the same population head-to-head.
Indirect comparison: By comparing the pooled results of studies that assessed accuracy of screening tests in separate populations. 
The ability of screening tests to detect severe coronary artery stenosis (≥ 70% stenosis detected on coronary angiography) was also assessed and compared among different screening tests. 
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We also investigated if diagnostic accuracy varied among studies with different prevalence of symptomatic chest pain and analysed the effect. For this analysis, we included only studies that used a threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis on coronary angiography for the diagnosis of CAD. To avoid partial verification, we considered effects among study participants who underwent both the index test and coronary angiography. This methodology meant that we were able to avoid partial verification.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included all diagnostic cross sectional studies, cohort studies and randomised studies of test accuracy that compared cardiac test accuracy with results obtained from coronary angiography (the reference standard). </type_of_study>
  <participants>
Study participants included all patients who were considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time the diagnostic tests were performed. 
Inclusion criteria
We included studies reporting outcomes relating to patients considered to be potential candidates for kidney transplantation or kidney-pancreas transplantation at the time diagnostic tests were performed. To ensure that our review was accessible and succinct, we chose to limit the population to patients with CKD who were considered candidates for kidney transplantation, but included all possible tests used to diagnose CAD.
Exclusion criteria
Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly state that all study participants were candidates for kidney transplantation. We also excluded studies that investigated cardiac test accuracy in patients with ESKD who were not transplant candidates (i.e. they were unselected dialysis patients, not undergoing pre-transplant assessment). Patients with ESKD who are not transplantation candidates differ from patients who are transplant candidates with respect to several key prognostic variables, such as age and fitness for surgery. These differences in the key prognostic variables may result in differences in disease prevalence and test performance. We also excluded studies which investigated patients with features of acute coronary syndrome as our aim was to investigate the performance of cardiac tests in a preoperative screening context. Where it appeared that only some of the study participants were transplantation candidates, we contacted the study authors requesting separate data for only transplantation candidates.</participants>

MPS
Stress
Exercise
dipyridamole
dobutamine
Radionucleotide
thallium-201 or Tc-99m sestamibi radionucleotide agents
  This compares perfusion of myocardium at rest and after a ‘stress’ such as exercise or drugs (e.g. dipyridamole).

When coronary arteries are normal, ‘stress’ results in vasodilatation and increased coronary blood flow. However, diseased coronary arteries cannot dilate because they are already maximally dilated and there is no increase in blood flow after a stress. MPS reveals these areas as regions of decreased perfusion. A reversible perfusion defect is a sign of ischaemia. A fixed defect (when there is decreased perfusion before, during and after the stress) is an indicator of infarction.
Pharmacological agents overcome limitations of exercise testing in patients with kidney disease
Non-invasive
Provides information regarding functional status of myocardium under stress conditions
Neither 100% sensitive nor specific
Radiation dose
Results subject to interpretation and reader bias
False positives due to increase in attenuation artefacts caused by left ventricular hypertrophy
False negatives due to balanced ischaemia (e.g. triple vessel disease)

Dichotomous (i.e. stress test positive or stress test negative) None. However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation
DSE
Stress
Exercise
dobutamine
Stress echocardiography compares the regional wall motion and thickness of myocardium both at rest and after stress. Regional systolic dysfunction is usually caused by CAD.

Exercise ECG
Bruce protocol stress ECG
Patient exercises on a treadmill while connected to an ECG. The level of exercise is increased in progressive stages. The patient's symptoms and blood pressure response are checked repeatedly. Ischaemic ECG changes or angina symptoms brought on by exercise are highly suggestive of underlying CAD
Non-invasive
Provides information regarding functional status of myocardium under stress conditions
Neither 100% sensitive nor specific
Results subject to interpretation and reader bias
Often limited by the inability of CKD patients to achieve an adequate peak exercise workload, development of exercise-induced hypotension
High proportion have abnormal baseline ECG (left ventricular hypertrophy)
Dichotomous (i.e. stress test positive or stress test negative) No. However, whether a stress test is interpreted as positive or negative depends largely on observer interpretation
Coronary artery calcium score
EBCT
Multidetector computed tomography
Cardiac calcium scoring is a non-invasive test that uses computed tomography to detect the presence of calcium in plaque on the walls of the arteries of the heart (coronary arteries). A calcium score is then derived, calculated as a summation of all calcified lesions in the coronary arteries. The calcium score is then compared with a reference range appropriate to a patient's age and sex. High calcium scores are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular events Non-invasive
Neither 100% sensitive nor specific
Radiation dose
  Continuous There is no uniformly agreed cut-off value at which patients are considered at high risk of CAD. We planned to analyse results by combining data from studies which share identical cut-off values
Echocardiography
Trans-thoracic

Assesses not only the lumen of the vessel but also the wall. It can also demonstrate soft atheromatous plaques, which cannot be demonstrated on conventional coronary angiography
Radiation dose
Contrast nephropathy
Inability to provide opportunity for immediate intervention (as opposed to coronary angiography)
Dichotomous (i.e. presence or absence of significant CAD)
Yes (i.e. ≥ 50% stenosis or ≥ 70% stenosis)
We planned to manage the issue of different cut points by involving an analysis that included:
All studies regardless of threshold of CAD on coronary angiography (these will include both studies which have ≥ 50% stenosis and ≥ 70% stenosis
Only studies which had ≥ 70% stenosis threshold
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the heart that enables evaluation of its structure and function
Non-invasive

Enables assessment of structure of myocardium
High spatial resolution means low inter-observer variability
Neither highly sensitive nor specific
  Dichotomous (e.g. presence or absence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction) None
Resting ECG Transthoracic interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over time captured and externally recorded by skin electrodes Provides information regarding the electrical function of the myocardium, which may suggest pre-existing ischaemia, left ventricular hypertrophy or arrhythmias
Neither sensitive nor specific

Neither highly sensitive nor specific
Does not provide any information on cardiac function
Continuous Yes. This will vary depending on the institution (e.g. 0.75 mm)
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Evaluates both cardiac and pulmonary function. Cardiac function is evaluated in terms of aerobic capacity and respiratory function.
The subject is exercised on a bicycle ergometer or treadmill. The test enables calculation of maximal aerobic capacity and the point during exercise where anaerobic metabolism is used to supplement aerobic metabolism as a source of energy. These can be measured via gas exchange data
Non-invasive measurement of ventricular function, respiratory function and cellular function via measurement of gas exchange, as well as detection of myocardial ischaemia
Excellent method of evaluating fitness and operative fitness
Not commonly performed
Dichotomous (e.g. stress ECG positive or stress ECG negative; presence or absence of cardiac failure) and
Continuous (e.g. measurement of the maximum aerobic capacity and anaerobic threshold)
Yes, although these will vary for different variables and for different institutions
DSF Used to detect coronary artery calcification. Digital subtraction improves resolution of conventional fluoroscopic methods
Non-invasive
Non exercise
Not commonly used
Radiation dose
Dichotomous (i.e. presence or absence of calcification) None
