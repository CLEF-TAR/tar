Title: 18F-FDG PET for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 

Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the ¹⁸F-FDG-PET index test for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to ADD or other forms of dementia at follow-up. Although we want to identify whether 'early forms of Alzheimer's disease dementia' are present at the moment of examination, there is no reference standard to make a final diagnosis of early ADD. Follow-up is therefore needed to reconstruct what was going on at the time of the index examination. In this context, it is clear that the duration of follow-up becomes critical, i.e. sufficiently long to capture the natural course of conversion.
