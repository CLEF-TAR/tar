Title: Physical tests for shoulder impingements and local lesions of bursa, tendon or labrum that may accompany impingement 

Objective:To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of physical tests, applied singly or in combination, for shoulder impingements (subacromial or internal) or local lesions of bursa, rotator cuff or labrum that may accompany impingement, in people whose symptoms and/or history suggest any of these disorders.
We also examined the physical tests according to whether they were intended to:
identify impingement in general (or differentiate it from other causes of shoulder pain, e.g. 'frozen shoulder')
subcategorise impingement as subacromial outlet impingement (impingement under the acromion process) or internal impingement (impingement within the shoulder joint)
diagnose lesions of bursa, tendon or glenoid labrum that may be associated with impingement
form part of a diagnostic package or process and, if so, according to the stages at which they may apply.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity.
Study population: older general population; young athletic population; other well defined groups e.g. wheelchair users or swimmers (see the Differences between protocol and review)
Stage of clinical care: primary (generally in the community setting), secondary (referral following preliminary screening) or tertiary (referral to a specialist centre)
Study design: cross sectional (or cohort) versus case-control; retrospective versus prospective design
Type of reference test. This will vary according to the target condition and setting, but generally surgery versus non-invasive imaging will be considered (seeTable 3)
Aspects of study conduct, specifically: blinding and reporting of uninterpretable or intermediate results.
