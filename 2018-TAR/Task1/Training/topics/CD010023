Title: Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging versus bone scintigraphy for clinically suspected scaphoid fractures in patients with negative plain radiographs 

Objective: The primary aim of this study is to identify the most suitable diagnostic imaging strategy for identifying clinically suspected fractures of the scaphoid bone in patients with normal radiographs. Therefore we looked at the diagnostic performance characteristics (Appendix 1) of the most used imaging modalities for this purpose: computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scintigraphy.
