Title: Magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance arthrography and ultrasonography for assessing rotator cuff tears in people with shoulder pain for whom surgery is being considered 

Objective: To compare the diagnostic test accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and ultrasonography (US) for detecting any rotator cuff tears (i.e. partial or full thickness) in people with shoulder pain for whom surgery is being considered.
We divided our objectives as follows.
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of US, MRI and MRA for diagnosing any rotator cuff tears (partial or full thickness)
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of US, MRI and MRA for diagnosing full thickness rotator cuff tears (one or more tendons)
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of US, MRI and MRA for diagnosing partial thickness rotator cuff tears
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We planned to investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity:
Type of tear: acute traumatic and chronic degenerative
Type of reference standard: open (including mini-open) surgery or arthroscopy
