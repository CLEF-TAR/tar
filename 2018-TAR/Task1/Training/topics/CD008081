Title: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) for detection of macular oedema in patients with diabetic retinopathy 

Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of OCT for detecting DMO and CSMO, defined according to ETDRS 1985, in patients referred to ophthalmologists after DR is detected. In the update of this review we also aimed to assess whether OCT might be considered the new reference standard for detecting DMO.
