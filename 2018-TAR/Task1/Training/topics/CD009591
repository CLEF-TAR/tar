Title: Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis 

Objective:To provide the estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.
To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites.
Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.
