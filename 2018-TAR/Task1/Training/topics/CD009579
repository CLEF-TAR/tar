Title: Circulating antigen tests and urine reagent strips for diagnosis of active schistosomiasis in endemic areas 

Objective: 
With the goals of making recommendations and informing policy makers on which tests to use and identifying research gaps, these were our primary objectives:
To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urine reagent strip tests for microhaematuria, proteinuria, and leukocyturia in detecting active S. haematobium infection, with microscopy of urine as the reference standard.
To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of circulating antigen tests—a urine POC circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test, a urine and serum CCA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, and a urine and serum circulating anodic antigen (CAA) test—for detection of active Schistosoma infection in geographical regions endemic for S. mansoni or S. haematobium or both, with microscopy as the reference standard.
To compare the accuracy of the above index tests.
To investigate potential sources of heterogeneity in the diagnostic accuracy of the tests listed above.
