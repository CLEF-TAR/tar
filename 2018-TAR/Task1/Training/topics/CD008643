Title: Red flags to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with low-back pain 

Objective: This review aims to provide information on the diagnostic accuracy of tests used to screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting with LBP or lumbar spine examination. Specifically, the review aims to assess the performance of information collected during the history taking or physical assessment (potential red flags). Such information will assist clinicians in making decisions about the appropriate management course in patients with LBP.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
Where feasible, the review will assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of red flags used to screen for vertebral fracture. In particular the influences of study design (e.g. consecutive series or case-control), healthcare setting (e.g. primary or secondary care), and aspects of study methods as reflected in the items of the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) checklist (Appendix 1), will be assessed.
