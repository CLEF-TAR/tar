## Sub-Task 1: No Boolean Search

Prior to constructing a Boolean Query researchers have to design and write a search protocol
that in written and in detail defines what constitutes a relevant study for their review.
In this experimental task of the TAR lab, participants will be provided with the relevant pieces of a protocol,
in an attempt to complete search effectively and efficiently bypassing the construction of the Boolean query.


*Input*:

For each topic participants will be provided with
- the Topic-ID
- The title of the review, written by Cochrane experts;
- A part of the protocol: The Objective
- The entire PubMED database (it can be downloaded directly from PubMED).


*Data Set*:

Participants will be provided with a test set consisting of 30 topics of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews.
If time allows it the organizers will also produce the relevant parts of protocols for the CLEF 2017 TAR data
to be used as training material.
