## Sub-Task 2: Abstract and Title Screening

Given the results of the Boolean Search from stage 1 as the starting point,
participants will be asked to rank the set of abstracts (A). The task has two  goals
(i)  to produce an the efficient ordering of the documents,
such that all of the relevant abstracts are retrieved as early as possible,  and
(ii) to identify a subset of  A which contains all or as many of the relevant abstracts
for the least effort (i.e. total number of abstracts to be assessed).

*Input*:

For each topic participants will be provided with:
- Topic-ID
- The title of the review, written by Cochrane experts;
- The Boolean query manually constructed by Cochrane experts;
- The set of PubMed Document Identifiers (PID's) returned by running the query in MEDLINE.

*Data Set*:

Participants will be provided with a test set consisting of 30 topics of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) reviews.
Participants can  use the CLEF 2017 TAR 42 (excluding topics that were reviewed and found unreliable) topics as training set.
