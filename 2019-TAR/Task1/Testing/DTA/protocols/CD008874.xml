  <Objectives>The objective of this review was to characterize and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the Mallampati classification and other commonly used airway examination tests for assessing the physical status of the airway in adult patients with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities. We performed this individually for each of the four descriptors of the difficult airway: difficult face mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult tracheal intubation, and failed intubation.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Types of studies
We considered diagnostic test accuracy studies (case‐control or consecutive series) of any individual index test or a combination of the tests listed in Table 1 against a reference standard. We required studies to provide data for true positives, false positives, false negatives and true negatives. We excluded studies that were reported only in abstract form, were uncontrolled reports (case series, case reports), randomized controlled trials of test‐treatment design that are more appropriately analysed as intervention than as diagnostic test accuracy studies, and studies that examined an index test other than bedside tests (for example, those involving radiological imaging).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Participants
We included adults of either sex, aged 16 years or greater, without obvious airway abnormalities who were having laryngoscopy performed with a standard laryngoscope (usually size 3 Macintosh blade) and the trachea intubated with a styletted or non‐styletted tracheal tube. We excluded studies performed in populations with a high prevalence of abnormal airways (maxillofacial trauma, cervical spine trauma, or otorhinolaryngology tumours) or those performed using specialized laryngoscopes or techniques (for example, awake fibreoptic intubation).</TypesofParticipants>
<IndexTests>Index tests
We included bedside tests used singly or in combination for detection of a difficult airway. These include any version of the Mallampati test (Ezri 2001; Mallampati 1985; Samsoon 1987), Wilson risk score (Wilson 1988), thyromental distance (Lewis 1994), sternomental distance (Ramadhani 1996), mouth opening test (Calder 2003), and upper lip bite test (Khan 2003), but were not limited to these tests. We collected information on the inter‐ or intraobserver correlation of the tests, or both, if reported or referenced in the study.</IndexTests>
<TargetConditions>Target conditions
The target condition was difficult airway. Although the difficult airway does not have a reference standard other than the result of the actual attempted airway management for a patient, the 2003 practice guidelines of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), suggested using at least four descriptions of difficult airway events (ASA 2003), as follows.
Difficult face mask ventilation.
Difficult laryngoscopy.
Difficult tracheal intubation.
Failed intubation.</TargetConditions>
<ReferenceStandards>Reference standards
As outline above in Target condition being diagnosed, the reference standards were: difficult face mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult tracheal intubation, and failed intubation. As there were no standard definitions for the reference standards, we accepted the authors' definition used for each study.</ReferenceStandards>
