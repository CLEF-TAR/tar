Title: Transabdominal ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis of gallbladder polyps 

Objective: 
To summarise and compare the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), for the detection of gallbladder polyps, for differentiating between true and pseudo gallbladder polyps, or for differentiating between dysplastic polyps/carcinomas and adenomas/pseudo polyps of the gallbladder in adults.
Secondary objectives
To explore the following sources of heterogeneity:
Methodological quality as assessed by QUADAS‚Äê2 (low compared to high/unclear);
Prospective compared to retrospective studies;
TAUS characteristics: type of the probe (linear compared to curved), frequency of the probe (low: 2 to 5 MHz compared to high: 5 to 8 MHz), and type of scanning (conventional grey, pulsed, colour, Doppler);
EUS characteristics; type of endoscope (radial compared to linear), frequency of the probe (less than 15 MHz compared to more than 15 MHz);
Experience of performer of TAUS and EUS (five years or more compared to less than five years of experience);
Symptomatic compared to asymptomatic people;
Presence compared to absence of gallstones.
