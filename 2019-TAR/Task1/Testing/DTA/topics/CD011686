Title: Triage tools for detecting cervical spine injury in pediatric trauma patients 

Objective: 
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C‐spine Rule in a pediatric population evaluated for CSI following blunt trauma.
Secondary objectives
We expected to observe heterogeneity in the estimates of diagnostic accuracy. Factors that may contribute to heterogeneous results include:
Differences in the healthcare setting and study design; previous studies state that CSI is seen less often in general emergency departments than in pediatric trauma hospitals, and that a CT of the neck is more common in general emergency departments (Adelgais 2014).
Study quality, as assessed by the QUADAS‐2 checklist (Whiting 2011).
Age‐related differences; we expect that both the applicability of the NEXUS criteria and the Canadian C‐spine Rule and the type of injury will differ according to age in children younger and older than eight (Leonard 2013; Leonard 2014).
