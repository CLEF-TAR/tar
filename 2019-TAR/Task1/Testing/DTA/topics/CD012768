Title: Xpert® MTB/RIF assay for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance 

Objective: 
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert a) for extrapulmonary TB by site of disease in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB; and b) for rifampicin resistance in people presumed to have extrapulmonary TB.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity on test accuracy across the included studies.
For extrapulmonary TB, covariates of interest were microscopy smear status, HIV status, anti‐TB treatment, past history of TB, reference standard used to verify pleural TB, and prevalence of extrapulmonary TB (culture confirmed) in included studies. For CSF, we considered the presence of a concentration step and specimen volume. For tissue specimens, we considered whether the WHO standard operating procedure was followed.
In addition, for TB meningitis, pleural TB, and lymph node TB, we adjusted accuracy estimates by applying a latent class meta‐analysis model to account for the imperfect nature of culture as the reference standard.
For detection of rifampicin resistance, the covariate of interest in included studies was the prevalence of rifampicin resistance.
