Title: Point‐of‐care ultrasonography for diagnosing thoracoabdominal injuries in patients with blunt trauma 

Objective: 
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of POCS for detection and exclusion of:
free fluid in the thoracic or abdominal cavities;
organ injuries with or without bleeding in the thoracic or abdominal cavities;
vascular lesions of the thoracic or abdominal aorta, or other major vessels; and
other injuries (e.g. pneumothorax);
compared to the following diagnostic reference standards: computed tomography (CT; 'pan‐scan'), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thoracotomy, laparotomy, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, autopsy, or any combination of these.
Secondary objectives
The secondary objectives of this review were to investigate the influence of individual study and cohort characteristics such as the:
reference standard;
target condition;
patient age (paediatric versus non‐paediatric);
patient disease status: type of trauma, type of injury, haemodynamic stability, injury severity or probability of survival;
environment;
operator's expertise and background;
hardware;
test thresholds;
on both positive and negative POCS scans.
More details are provided in the Investigations of heterogeneity section of the review.
