Title: Non‚Äêinvasive diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection 

Objective: 
To compare the diagnostic accuracy of urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen test, alone or in combination, for diagnosis of H pylori infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic people, so that eradication therapy for H pylori can be started.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the following potential sources of heterogeneity: type of reference standard, risk of bias, publication status, prospective versus retrospective studies, symptomatic versus asymptomatic participants, recent or current use of proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics, different subtypes of tests, and the interval between the index test and reference standard.
