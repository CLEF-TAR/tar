Title: Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing tumour resectability in advanced epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer 

Objective: 
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose‐18 (FDG) PET/CT, conventional and diffusion‐weighted (DW) MRI as replacement or add‐on to abdominal CT, for assessing tumour resectability at primary debulking surgery in women with stage III to IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the year of study initiation, the annual surgical caseload, and whether surgery is performed by a gynaecological oncologist as possible sources of heterogeneity. For further details, please see Investigations of heterogeneity.
