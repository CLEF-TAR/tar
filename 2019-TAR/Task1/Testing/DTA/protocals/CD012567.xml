  <Objectives>To assess the diagnostic accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose‐18 (FDG) PET/CT, conventional and diffusion‐weighted (DW) MRI as replacement or add‐on to abdominal CT, for assessing tumour resectability at primary debulking surgery in women with stage III to IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the year of study initiation, the annual surgical caseload, and whether surgery is performed by a gynaecological oncologist as possible sources of heterogeneity. For further details, please see Investigations of heterogeneity.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Types of studies
We included randomised comparisons of diagnostic tests, cross‐sectional, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, that address the DTA of preoperative PET(‐CT), conventional or (additional) diffusion‐weighted MRI on assessing tumour resectability in women who are scheduled to undergo primary debulking surgery. Studies which added the index test(s) on to abdominal CT or when the index test replaced abdominal CT, were included. To evaluate the add‐on effect, the alternative imaging test had to be performed within four weeks before or after the abdominal CT. Studies following a case‐control design, which carry an inherent high risk of bias in a DTA research objective, were excluded.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Participants
Studies had to include adult (18 years of age or more) women diagnosed with advanced stage (stage III to IV) epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer, considered eligible for primary debulking surgery (i.e. no adjuvant chemotherapy treatment or prior surgery to assess tumour extension was performed). Also, studies with participants in stage I to IV disease were included if data from women with stage III to IV disease could be extracted.</TypesofParticipants>
<IndexTests>Index tests
The index tests of interest were preoperatively performed fluorodeoxyglucose‐18 PET(‐CT), conventional and diffusion‐weighted MRI (see; Index test(s)). All these imaging modalities were used as a replacement or as an add‐on to abdominal CT in women with advanced epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer.
A positive index test was defined as an assessment of tumour spread in which resection at primary debulking surgery was judged to be unfeasible (i.e. index test indicates ‘tumour is not resectable’) by the radiologist or multidisciplinary tumour board. Conversely, a negative index test was defined as a tumour for which resection by primary debulking surgery was considered feasible.</IndexTests>
<TargetConditions>Target conditions
The target condition was defined as the resectability of all deposits from epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer at primary debulking surgery. This target condition had three categories (see; Target condition being diagnosed) which makes two commonly studied and clinically relevant dichotomisations possible (see: Statistical analysis and data synthesis).</TargetConditions>
<ReferenceStandards>Reference standards
The reference standard was the process of debulking surgery. This is most commonly performed via a laparotomy, although in recent years laparoscopy has also been performed in cases of limited disease volume. During such a procedure, the abdomen is systematically explored to assess the tumour spread and its resectability. The outcome category (size of residual tumour after surgery) was determined by the surgeon at the end of this surgery.</ReferenceStandards>
