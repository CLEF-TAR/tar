  <Objectives>Primary objectives
To identify which diagnostic tools, including updated versions, most accurately diagnose ASD in preschool children when compared with multi‐disciplinary team clinical judgement.
To identify how the best of the interview tools compare with CARS, then how CARS compares with ADOS.
Which ASD diagnostic tool ‐ among ADOS, ADI‐R, CARS, DISCO, GARS, and 3di ‐ has the best diagnostic test accuracy?
Is the diagnostic test accuracy of any one test sufficient for that test to be suitable as a sole assessment tool for preschool children?
Is there any combination of tests that, if offered in sequence, would provide suitable diagnostic test accuracy and enhance test efficiency?
If data are available, does the combination of an interview tool with a structured observation test have better diagnostic test accuracy (i.e. fewer false‐positives and fewer false‐negatives) than either test alone?
As only one interview tool was identified, we modified the first three aims to a single aim (Differences between protocol and review): This Review evaluated diagnostic tests in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Specificity is the most important factor for diagnosis; however, both sensitivity and specificity are of interest in this Review because there is an inherent trade‐off between these two factors.
Secondary objectives
To determine whether any diagnostic test has greater diagnostic test accuracy for age‐specific subgroups within the preschool age range.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Types of studies
Eligible studies were:
cohort studies or cross‐sectional studies;
randomised studies of test accuracy ‐ participants had been randomised to different index tests and all participants had been verified by the same gold standard; and
case‐control studies ‐ participants had been selected on the outcome side (i.e. a sample of patients with ASD (e.g. selected from an existing cohort) and a sample of children without ASD from a different source).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Participants
Participants were children suspected of having an ASD who were being seen prospectively because of concerns with social, communication, and/or behavioural problems of the type seen in autism. Age was restricted to the preschool years; however, if study cohorts included children beyond six years of age, we included analyses if the mean age of participants was less than six years. We placed no restrictions on setting.</TypesofParticipants>
<IndexTests>Index tests
We assessed the following index tests for ASD.
Parent or carer interviews: Autism Diagnosis Interview ‐ Revised (ADI‐R); Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) ‐ Tenth Revision (DISCO‐10) ‐ or DISCO ‐ Eleventh Revision (DISCO‐11); Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) ‐ Second Edition (GARS‐2) ‐ or Third Edition (GARS‐3); and the Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di).
Combination of interview and observations of unstructured activity: Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) or CARS ‐ Second Edition (CARS‐2).
Semi‐structured observational assessment: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), ADOS‐Generic (ADOS‐G), or ADOS ‐ Second Edition (ADOS‐2).</IndexTests>
<TargetConditions>Target conditions
The target condition was ASD in preschool children. ASD can be diagnosed according to DSM‐5 (APA 2013). Diagnostic subgroups of autism (childhood autism (ICD‐10) or autistic disorder (DSM‐IV)); pervasive developmental disorder (atypical autism (ICD‐10), pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified (ICD‐10), or pervasive developmental disorder ‐ not otherwise specified (PDD‐NOS) (DSM‐IV)); and Asperger syndrome or Asperger disorder were grouped together as ASD (APA 1994; APA 2000; WHO 2007).</TargetConditions>
<ReferenceStandards>Reference standards
The reference standard was a clinical diagnosis of ASD, as defined above, based on a classification system that was accepted at the time of the Review (DSM ‐ Third Edition (DSM‐III; APA 1980); DSM‐III‐ Revised (DSM‐III‐R; APA 1987); DSM‐IV (APA 1994); DSM‐IV‐TR (APA 2000); DSM‐5 (APA 2013); ICD‐9 (WHO 1992); or ICD‐10 (WHO 2007)) and as assigned by an experienced multi‐disciplinary team. Assessment by the multi‐disciplinary team included evaluation of social behaviour, language and non‐verbal communication, adaptive behaviour, atypical behaviour, and cognitive status or intellectual function. This assessment was based on information from a clinical assessment, from health professionals involved in the child's care, and from those caring for the child in community settings such as preschool or child care settings.
It is known that diagnosis of specific ASD varies over time; therefore, the reference standard assessment and the index test must have been performed within six months of each other.</ReferenceStandards>
