  <Objectives>
to assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for the development of T2DM and to assess how many people with IH revert back to normoglycaemia (regression).
to assess the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>
Prospective cohort studies investigating either the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM or IH versus normoglycaemia as a prognostic factor for developing T2DM (Altman 2001).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>
To study the overall prognosis of people with IH and regression from IH to normoglycaemia, we included cohort studies in people with IH at baseline, defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these. IH had to be established by standard cut‐off values for IFG, IGT or elevated HbA1c, as defined by ADA or WHO (ADA 1997; ADA 2003; ADA 2010; ICH 1997; IEC 2009; WHO 1998; WHO/IDF 2006).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
Our outcome of primary interest was the diagnosis of newly developed T2DM (T2DM incidence). T2DM incidence should have been diagnosed by blood glucose measurements such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), two‐hour postload glucose (PG) or HbA1c. Diagnosis could have been combined with self‐reported diabetes, physician‐diagnosed diabetes or use of antihyperglycaemic medications such as oral hypoglycaemic drugs, insulin or both.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
