Title: Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation of preterm infants at birth 

Objective: 
To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short‐ and long‐term mortality and morbidity. Primary comparison Any of the lower concentrations of oxygen (21%, air; > 21% to 29%, very low; ≥ 30% to 39%, low) versus any of the higher concentrations of oxygen (≥ 40% to 59%, high; ≥ 60% to 100%, very high). The primary comparison was analysed by the following subgroups: targeted oxygen saturation (lower or higher limit for oxygen saturation target range for titration < 85%; 85% to 90%; 91% to 95%; > 95%); type of oxygen saturation monitor (fractional or functional oxygen saturation); gestation (< 28 weeks; 28 weeks to 32 weeks; 33 to 36 weeks). Secondary analyses We did not include studies comparing two oxygen concentrations considered to be either in the lower or the higher ranges in the primary analyses. We planned to perform secondary analyses for studies comparing two groups that were both in the lower, or higher, oxygen concentration range (for example, 50% versus 100%).
