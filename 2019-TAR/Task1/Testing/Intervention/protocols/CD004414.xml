  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effects of primary preventive interventions and strategies (physical and behavioural) for preventing occupational irritant hand dermatitis (OIHD) in healthy people (who have no hand dermatitis) who work in occupations where the skin is at risk of damage due to contact with water, detergents, chemicals or other irritants, or from wearing gloves.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion, which investigated the efficacy of interventions in the primary prevention of occupational irritant hand dermatitis (OIHD), and were conducted under normal working conditions in the work place. We included parallel, split‐body, or cross‐over trials. We did not include controlled clinical trials (CCTs) because they provide a lower level of evidence.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We considered any employee in 'wet work' occupations for inclusion, where there is a risk of developing OIHD (incident cases), e.g. nurses, hairdressers, employees in the food processing industry, cleaners, metal workers, printers, bricklayers, etc. We included only primary prevention studies and not studies where participants had existing hand dermatitis, unless the participant population was mixed and disaggregated data were available for those participants who were healthy with no hand dermatitis at the start of the study. Whether or not hand dermatitis was present at baseline was decided based on the baseline data reported by the study investigators. The diagnostic criteria were not evaluated in this regard.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We included studies of interventions for the primary prevention of OIHD, in working populations. This did not include experimental studies. Examples of primary prevention interventions include: barrier creams; moisturisers; protective gloves; complex interventions using combinations of interventions e.g. barrier creams, moisturisers, and protective gloves; skin protection education. We included studies in which interventions were compared with another intervention or compared with no intervention.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>We included studies that measured the following outcomes, at any follow‐up time. Primary outcomes The proportion of participants developing any signs and symptoms of OIHD (incident cases) measured by clinical scores (IGA) and/or hand dermatitis scores (e.g. HECSI, Manuscore) as rated by the investigator (physician/nurse) or the participant. Frequency of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of the target intervention. However, we did examine data on adverse effects from the included studies we identified. Secondary outcomes Severity of clinical signs and symptoms in incident cases of OIHD (measured by clinical scores (IGA) or hand dermatitis scores, e.g. HECSI, Manuscore), or both, as rated by the investigator (physician/nurse) or the participant. Proportion of participants with significant changes (difference in average score or difference from baseline, or both) in barrier function or hydration, measured using TEWL (skin barrier), and corneometry (skin hydration). Change of occupation because of OIHD versus staying in the occupation. Proportion of participants satisfied with the products given (cosmetic, preventive, therapeutic properties of the products). Other adverse outcomes: those that are not severe enough to warrant participants to leave the study (e.g. mild irritation or other complaints about products applied in the studies).</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
