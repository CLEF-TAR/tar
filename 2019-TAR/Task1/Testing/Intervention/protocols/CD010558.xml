  <Objectives>To assess the effectiveness of psychotherapies for adults with TRD.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>This review includes RCTs and cluster RCTs. This review includes trials using a cross‐over design but only data from the first treatment phase. Excluded from this review are trials of any other study design, including quasi‐randomised studies and non‐randomised studies.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Age range Participants must be 18 to 74 years of age. We excluded any study that included some participants younger than 75 years and some older than 74 years if the mean age of participants was over 74 years. Similarly, we excluded any study that included some participants younger than 18 years and some older than 18 years if the mean age of participants was less than 18 years. Definition of treatment‐resistant depression We defined treatment resitsant depression as "A primary diagnosis of unipolar depression that has not responded (or has only partially responded) to a minimum of four weeks of antidepressant treatment at a recommended dose (at least 150 mg/d imipramine or equivalent antidepressant (e.g. 20 mg/d citalopram))." We excluded studies that included people who had not responded because of intolerance of antidepressant medication. Although initiatives have sought to improve access to psychological therapies in England and elsewhere, access to psychological treatment remains limited and antidepressants are often given as first‐line treatment for adults with depression. Therefore, this review does not include studies of interventions intended for those who have not responded to psychological treatment. Diagnosis Acceptable diagnoses of unipolar depression include those based on criteria from DSM‐IV‐TR or earlier versions of this publication (APA 2000), International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10 (WHO 1992), Feighner criteria (Feighner 1972), or Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer 1978). We excluded studies that did not use standardised diagnostic criteria. Comorbidities Excluded from this review are studies of participants with comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Also excluded are studies including participants with both unipolar and bipolar depression unless data are available for the subgroup of unipolar participants. This review includes studies involving participants with comorbid physical conditions or other psychological disorders (e.g. anxiety) for whom psychological therapy was not being primarily used to manage the physical illness, in other words, the focus of treatment was TRD ‐ not the comorbidity.</TypesofParticipants>
