  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of antidepressants for insomnia in adults.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster and cross‐over RCTs.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included adults (aged 18 or over) with a diagnosis of insomnia (to include Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM‐IV), International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, 10th revision (ICD‐10) (WHO 1992), and other well‐recognised classifications), We also included participants with insomnia defined on validated rating scales such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Sleep subscale (HAM‐D Insomnia). We included all participant types (including people with comorbid depression or anxiety disorder and other comorbidities).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Experimental intervention We included any antidepressant (administered for at least three days) as monotherapy including all doses. We organised antidepressants into classes for the purposes of this review, as follows. SSRIs: fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram. TCAs: amitriptyline, imipramine, trimipramine, doxepin, desipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, clomipramine, dothiepin, lofepramine. Heterocyclic antidepressants: mianserin, amoxapine, maprotiline. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): irreversible: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid; reversible: brofaramine, moclobemide, tyrima. 'Other' antidepressants: noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NARIs): reboxetine, atomoxetine; noradrenaline‐dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs): amineptine, bupropion; serotonin‐noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): venlafaxine, milnacipram, duloxetine; noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NASSAs): mirtazapine; serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs): trazodone; unclassified:agomelatine, vilazodone. Comparator interventions Placebo. Other medications for insomnia (e.g. benzodiazepines, 'Z' drugs). A different antidepressant. Waiting list control or treatment as usual.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Efficacy: any subjective improvement in sleep quality or satisfaction with sleep, total sleep duration (measured in hours or minutes), sleep onset latency (measured as time taken to fall asleep), number of nocturnal awakenings or total nocturnal awakening time (measured in hours or minutes) or sleep efficiency (measured as a ratio of time asleep to time in bed). A variety of rating scales were reported (e.g. the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse 1989); Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (Morin 2011); Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ‐ Sleep disturbance factor (HRSD or HAM‐D) (Hamilton 1960); visual analogue scales (VAS)). Safety: number and type of spontaneously reported and measured adverse events, including reports of toxicity. Secondary outcomes Objective measures of change in sleep (such as electroencephalogram (EEG) or PSG data). Tolerability: reported information on tolerability (e.g. problems with daytime drowsiness, dropout rates). Effect on daytime symptoms/functioning: reported information on changes in daytime symptoms/functioning. Timing of outcome assessments Some trials had multiple sleep diary end points. We report end points consistently reported across studies rather than the protocol‐stated primary end point.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
