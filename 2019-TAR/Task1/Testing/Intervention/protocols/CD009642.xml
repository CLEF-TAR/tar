  <Objectives>To assess the effects (benefits and risks) of perioperative intravenous (IV) lidocaine infusion compared to placebo/no treatment or compared to epidural analgesia on postoperative pain and recovery in adults undergoing various surgical procedures.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effect of perioperative lidocaine infusions versus no treatment, placebo treatment or versus epidural analgesia on relevant clinical outcomes. We excluded cross‐over trials, since this study design is not relevant for the current review.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included results obtained in adult (over 18 years) participants, independent of sex, undergoing any elective or urgent surgical procedure on any body part(s), and only if the procedure required general anaesthesia. Specifially, we excluded participants undergoing: any kind of emergency procedure, and minor surgical procedures, which are sometimes conducted using local or regional anaesthesia alone and do not provide a control event rate being high enough to demonstrate an effect of the investigated intervention.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We included all studies comparing the effect of continuous perioperative lidocaine infusion, either with no treatment or placebo treatment, or with epidural analgesia. The IV lidocaine infusion must have been started intraoperatively (with or without an IV bolus) prior to incision and continued until the end of surgery. In trials of this intervention, standard care to enhance the postoperative recovery after surgery should also be provided.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>We analysed the following outcome measures. Primary outcomes Pain score at rest (0 to 10 cm, 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), numeric rating scale (NRS)), at 'early', 'intermediate', and 'late time points' Gastrointestinal recovery: postoperative ileus (dichotomous), time to first defaecation/bowel movement (hours), time to first flatus (hours), and time to first bowel sounds (hours) Adverse events (dichotomous; e.g. death, arrhythmias, other heart rate disorders or any sign of lidocaine toxicity) Secondary outcomes Length of hospital stay (inpatient ‐ days; outpatient ‐ minutes) Functional postoperative neuropsychological status scales (e.g. quality of recovery (QoR) score or Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) Surgical complications (dichotomous; postoperative infections, thromboembolism, wound breakdown, etc.) Patient satisfaction (0 to 10 cm VAS, 0 to 100 mm VAS, 0 to 10 NRS) Cessation of the intervention (dichotomous; termination of the study before completion) We investigated two separate outcomes for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV): First, postoperative nausea including PONV, if nausea was not separately reported in the study (referred to below as 'nausea') and, second, postoperative vomiting, both at 'early time points' (dichotomous; in postanaesthesia care unit (PACU)) and 'overall' Intraoperative opioid consumption (remifentanil was separated from all other opioids due to an exceptional mode of action) Postoperative opioid consumption, 'in PACU' and 'overall' (in mg morphine equivalents (MEQ) When we reported 'early time points' for pain, nausea, vomiting, and opioid consumption, this referred to trials in which the outcome was reported approximately within the time period one to four hours postoperatively, or in the PACU. When we reported the 'intermediate' and 'late time points' for pain, this referred to pain ratings at 24 hours and 48 hours after surgery, respectively. In case of nausea, vomiting, and opioid consumption, 'overall' meant data that covered the time intervals from 0 to 24 hours, 0 to 48 hours, or 0 to 72 hours. We also accepted data that reported these outcomes for an interval from PACU (1 to 4 hours) to 24 hours, to 48 hours, or to 72 hours. If studies reported these outcomes for the 0 to 24‐hour time interval and later, we decided to analyse only the 0 to 24‐hour time interval. If studies did not explicitly report the time interval at which the outcome was documented, we grouped these data into the 'overall' category.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
