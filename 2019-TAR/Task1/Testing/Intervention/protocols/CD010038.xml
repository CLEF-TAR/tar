  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effects of face‐to‐face interventions for informing or educating parents about early childhood vaccination on vaccination status and parental knowledge, attitudes, and intention to vaccinate.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs. We excluded all studies rated at a high risk of bias on the random sequence generation criteria of the 'Risk of bias' tool, because we considered these studies to be quasi‐RCTs.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Communication interventions about childhood vaccination are often complex because multiple participant groups are involved in the delivery and receipt of the intervention. The intervention is delivered to one group (parents) to promote vaccination, which is administered to another group (children). The planning and implementation of the intervention or the vaccination programme itself is addressed by a third group (program organisers). The three participant groups were: Children: infants (less than 1 year) or preschool‐aged children (1 to 5 or 6 years). We only included RCTs with school‐aged children if the main focus of the intervention was vaccines whose primary series began in infancy or preschool‐aged children. Parents: parents, guardians, or others fulfilling the parental role, alone or in groups, targeted to receive face‐to‐face information or education, and who had at least one child due or overdue for childhood vaccinations. We also included participants who were expectant parents, individuals or couples currently pregnant, considering adoption, or otherwise expecting to become guardians of a child. The intervention could have been directed to parents individually or in groups.

<TypesofInterventions>Face‐to‐face communication interventions directed to parents to inform or educate them about routine childhood vaccinations. Such interventions describe or impart information about some feature of routine childhood vaccination with the purpose of changing parent knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behaviour, or self‐efficacy. The type of content that may be covered includes information about: vaccine‐preventable diseases (e.g. symptoms, prevalence, transmission, severity); vaccines (e.g. delivery method, dose, ingredients, schedule, risks or side effects, benefits); or vaccine service delivery (e.g. where to go to receive vaccinations, costs, clinic opening hours, services to assist with access). Despite potential heterogeneity of intervention content or intensity across studies, we agreed that interventions with the purpose of informing or educating parents about vaccination were sufficiently similar to conceptually group for analysis in this review. We included interventions delivered by anyone, including physicians, nurses, midwives, health visitors, or other healthcare professionals; trained volunteers; lay health workers; members of the community; or peers. The term 'routine vaccinations' means all routine childhood vaccines outlined by the WHO (WHO 2018). Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) was excluded, because it is delivered to adolescents. This review focused only on interventions about early childhood vaccines because interventions related to vaccines for older children may be significantly different in nature (e.g. they may target children directly, or have a reduced focus on the parent's role in decision making). We included face‐to‐face interventions conducted in cluster‐RCTs in the context of a mass vaccination campaign if it was possible to isolate and report the effects of the face‐to‐face communication interventions delivered to parents for the vaccination of young children or infants from the larger campaign. Similarly, we included multi‐component interventions with a face‐to‐face element if the outcomes of the face‐to‐face intervention alone could be determined from the reported data. For example, trials of multi‐component interventions involving face‐to‐face education plus reminders or health service access assistance measured both vaccination status and knowledge (Quinlivan 2003; Wood 1998). We could not isolate the effect of the face‐to‐face intervention on the vaccination rate, but we could attribute any changes in knowledge to the face‐to‐face educational intervention alone. We may also have been able to determine the effect of a face‐to‐face intervention if a trial measured outcomes at multiple or staged time points (or both), including assessment of the effects of one intervention component or type before the addition of other intervention types. We did not consider Interventions to be multi‐component if a secondary form of information or education (e.g. a pamphlet) was provided along with the face‐to‐face intervention that was specifically described as supplementary or supporting. In this updated review, we tightened our inclusion criteria with regard to complex, multi‐topic, early parenting education and information interventions (e.g. well‐child appointments or home visits). Such interventions generally cover a broad range of issues, which may be tailored to the individual participant. It is often unclear whether and what kind of vaccination information is discussed, or whether every participant receives the same information or education related to vaccination. These trials may measure vaccination uptake or status, but this may be used as a general health access indicator, and does not necessarily confirm that vaccination was a topic of discussion (or indeed a focus of the intervention). This review focused on face‐to‐face information or education that was specifically about vaccination, so our updated process for determining inclusion or exclusion of such studies was as follows: If the trial specifically described the vaccination content in the intervention, and it met other inclusion criteria, we included it. If the trial briefly mentioned that vaccination was a topic covered by the intervention, but did not describe the content in any detail, we included it only if it also measured a vaccination‐specific knowledge, attitude, or intention outcome (indicating that vaccination was covered to some degree within the content of the intervention). We excluded trials that only mentioned vaccination briefly or not at all, and measured only vaccination status, on the grounds that the intervention was not primarily an information or educational intervention about vaccination. We welcome contact from any authors who believe their studies may have been erroneously excluded based on our interpretation of the trial report. This updated review addressed two comparisons: Face‐to‐face interventions directed to parents versus control (usual care or passive intervention, i.e. non‐face‐to‐face information or education, or no intervention), Face‐to‐face intervention A versus face‐to‐face intervention B. We reduced the comparisons from the original review, which considered the effects of the intervention when directed to individual parents or to groups of parents. There was no clear evidence to suggest that education delivered in a group setting was likely to work differently from education delivered to individuals, and so we felt that this comparison was less informative for end users of the review. We included face‐to‐face interventions designed to inform or educate, which may have included oral sessions, lectures, one‐on‐one or group classes or seminars, information sessions, home visits, or outreach sessions. We did not include community‐directed interventions, as these were considered in the Saeterdal 2014 review.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Children: vaccination status of child (i.e. vaccination status up‐to‐date, or receipt of one or more vaccines, as defined by study authors); outcome domain: vaccination status and behaviours Parents: knowledge or understanding of vaccination; outcome domain: knowledge or understanding Parents: attitudes or beliefs about vaccination; outcome domain: attitudes or beliefs Parents: intention to vaccinate child; outcome domain: attitudes or beliefs All categories: adverse effects; outcome domain: any Secondary outcomes Parents: parent experience of intervention (e.g. satisfaction, assessment of communication); outcome domain: communication delivery and design Vaccine programme managers: cost of implementing intervention; outcome domain: cost Justification of outcome measures Our recent research to define and prioritise core outcome domains for the evaluation of vaccination communication interventions informed the selection of outcomes for this review (Kaufman 2017; Kaufman 2017a). First, we developed a taxonomy of potential vaccination communication outcomes that were derived from trials, non‐vaccination health communication studies, and focus groups with stakeholders (parents, healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers; Kaufman 2017). This taxonomy organised outcomes into eight domains: 1) knowledge or understanding, 2) attitudes or beliefs, 3) vaccination status and behaviours, 4) communication delivery and design, 5) community participation, 6) decision making, 7) health status and well‐being, and 8) cost. Using a Delphi survey, we asked representatives from each stakeholder group to rate the relative importance of each of these outcome domains when evaluating a communication intervention to inform or educate about vaccination (Kaufman 2017a). The top four domains for this type of intervention, according to stakeholders, were 'knowledge or understanding', 'attitudes or beliefs', 'vaccination status and behaviours', and 'communication delivery and design'. Therefore, we ensured that outcomes from each of these domains were captured by this review. While changes in knowledge are not always directly linked to changes in health behaviours, we included knowledge as a primary outcome because improving knowledge was the stated purpose of many programmes and interventions (Ryan 2014). Particularly with complex communication interventions, it was important to measure intermediate outcomes that reflected the intervention's purpose, in addition to endpoint outcomes, such as vaccination status (Craig 2008; Moore 2015; Petticrew 2011; WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy 2014). Doing so could help to unpack how and whether an intervention worked or where it broke down. In our taxonomy of outcomes, intention to vaccinate fell under the domain of 'attitudes or beliefs'. However, we decided to include two separate outcomes associated with this domain; one broadly defined as 'attitudes or beliefs', and the more specific outcome of 'intention to vaccinate'. Intention and attitudes are separate determinants of behaviour in most behaviour change theories (see How the intervention might work), with intention more directly preceding behaviour change. Changes in intention, but not behaviour, may indicate the presence of external barriers to vaccination (daCosta 2005). In comparison, changes in attitudes may be particularly relevant for identifying subtle shifts in vaccine acceptance or hesitancy that are not reflected by changes to either intentions or behaviours. We included the outcome 'parent experience of the intervention', because the way in which communication is delivered and received can substantially impact its overall effectiveness. For instance, parents cited poor communication experiences with healthcare providers made them less likely to consider or undertake vaccination (Leask 2012; Leask 2015). While it was not prioritised in the Delphi survey, we also included cost as an outcome in this review. The cost of implementing an intervention is particularly important to record, if it is measured, to improve equity in healthcare delivery and to increase the global applicability of research evidence. Cost is an important factor for decision and policy makers, so we included it, where reported. We included adverse events to capture any potential negative effects of the interventions ‐ for example, anxiety or distress ‐ and because it is Cochrane policy for systematic reviews to consider adverse effects (Loke 2011). We did not include or exclude studies on the basis of whether the chosen outcomes were measured or reported.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
