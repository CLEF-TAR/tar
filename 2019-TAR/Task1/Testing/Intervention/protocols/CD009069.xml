  <Objectives>available in English Español To evaluate the harms and protection of prophylactic human papillomaviruses (HPV) vaccines against cervical precancer and HPV16/18 infection in adolescent girls and women.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We considered only phase II and phase III randomised controlled trials (RCTs).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included studies enrolling female participants, without any age restriction, distinguishing: female participants with no evidence of baseline infection with high‐risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPV) types (this group reflects the first target of basic vaccination programmes, i.e. girls before onset of sexual activity); female participants with no evidence of baseline infection with HPV types included in the vaccines (per protocol population); all female participants regardless of baseline infection with HPV (this group reflects the target of catch‐up vaccination programs, adolescents or young adult women aged 15 to 26 years, where a considerable proportion may already have been exposed to HPV infection). The distinction of different participant categories by HPV status at enrolment is essential, since the trial outcomes are expected to differ in women who are already infected with HPV types included in the vaccine and those who are not infected, Further distinction was made by: broad age group (adolescents and young adult women, aged 15 to 26 years) and mid‐adult women (25 to 45 years); number of received doses: three doses in agreement with the trial protocol, at least one dose, and fewer than three doses (the latter analysis being a post‐hoc assessment); type of vaccine received (mono‐, bi‐ or quadrivalent vaccine). Studies with male participants or special target groups such as immunocompromised patients were not included. However, trials enrolling both female and male participants were potentially eligible under the condition that separate outcomes for female participants were reported or could be obtained from the authors.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Intervention Vaccination with prophylactic HPV vaccines containing virus‐like particles composed of the L1 capsid protein of HPV16 (monovalent vaccine), HPV16 and HPV18 (bivalent vaccine), or HPV6, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 (quadrivalent vaccine) (see Appendix 2). All vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection over a period of six months. The monovalent and quadrivalent vaccines were injected at zero, two and six months, whereas the bivalent vaccine was administered at zero, one and six months. Comparison Administration of placebo containing no active product or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, without L1 VLP, or another non‐HPV vaccine. In head‐to‐head trials comparing directly the bivalent with the quadrivalent vaccine, participants who received the bivalent vaccine constituted the experimental group and participants who received the quadrivalent vaccine were considered as the comparison group.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Histologically‐confirmed high‐grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2, CIN3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)) or worse, associated with the HPV types included in the vaccine or any lesions irrespective of HPV type. Association between HPV types and a diagnosed lesion means that the particular type or types have been detected in that lesion. These primary outcomes were judged by WHO to be adequate endpoints (Pagliusi 2004). Invasive cervical cancer. Safety/occurrence of adverse effects: local adverse effects (redness, swelling, pain, itching at the injection site); mild systemic effects; serious systemic effects; mortality; pregnancy outcomes observed during the trials, in particular occurrence of congenital anomalies. Secondary outcomes Incident infection with vaccine HPV types (HPV16 and HPV18, jointly; and HPV6, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 jointly). Persistent infection (persisting during at least six months or at least 12 months) with vaccine HPV types.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
