  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effects of vaccines for preventing typhoid fever.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Adults and children.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Intervention Vaccines against S. Typhi include the following. Live oral vaccine Ty2la or genetic modifications of this strain. Vi polysaccharide vaccine. Conjugate vaccines. Control No vaccine, placebo or typhoid‐inactive agents (vaccine for a different disease) Other typhoid vaccines For the secondary outcome of adverse events, we included only placebo‐controlled trials. Excluded interventions We excluded studies focusing on the following types of interventions. Trials that evaluated killed whole‐cell vaccines, because these vaccines are no longer in use. Trials that reported only on immunogenicity. Trials that assessed only adverse events but not clinical efficacy of vaccines that have not yet been evaluated for clinical efficacy. Human challenge studies where participants were artificially infected withS. Typhi at a certain time point following vaccination, since the bacterial inoculum in challenge trials is constant and the timing of infection relative to vaccination is highly controlled compared to the real life situation. We therefore believe these trials to be less relevant for clinicians and policy‐making.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Typhoid fever Typhoid fever defined by isolation of S. Typhi from blood cultures. Secondary outcomes Adverse events Serious adverse events, defined as leading to death, requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolonged existing hospitalization, life threatening, or resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Other adverse events, including fever, erythema at injection site, vomiting, and diarrhoea. When the occurrence of adverse events was reported after each of several doses, we extracted the occurrence following each dose separately. When reports provided estimates of the incidence of adverse events for different time points after vaccination, we presented the data corresponding to 24 hours after vaccination.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
