  <Objectives>To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non‐randomised studies.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We only included the following non‐randomised study designs (Higgins 2011). Comparative cohort studies. Here, the experimental group was children or adolescents with ADHD exposed to methylphenidate and the control group was comparable patients not exposed to methylphenidate. Patient‐control studies. Here, the patient ('case') group was children or adolescents with ADHD exposed to methylphenidate, and the control group was comparable patients not exposed to methylphenidate. Non‐comparative cohort studies. In this study type, children or adolescents with ADHD were exposed to methylphenidate with no control group. We also included the methylphenidate‐treated group from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD, as these trials were not included in our previous review of RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention (Storebø 2015). In this way, we were able to expand our evidence base on adverse events during methylphenidate administration (as such groups are comparable to classic cohort studies), without double‐counting from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention (Storebø 2015). For assessment of adverse events in RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention, the reader is referred to our systematic review on that topic (Storebø 2015). Patient reports/series. This study type was formerly known and also described in our protocol as 'case‐studies' (Storebø 2016). Cross‐sectional studies. For a description of cohort, cross‐sectional, and patient‐control studies, see Table 1. Open in table viewer Table 1. Study design Study design Description Cohort study An observational study in which a defined group with ≥ 1 samples of people (the cohort) is followed over time. The outcomes of people in subsets of this cohort might be compared, to examine people who were exposed or not exposed (or exposed at different levels) to a particular intervention or other factor of interest. A prospective cohort study assembles participants and follows them into the future. A retrospective (or historical) cohort study identifies participants from past records and follows them from the time of those records to the present. Because participants are not allocated by the investigator to different interventions or other exposures, adjusted analysis is usually required to minimise the influence of other factors (confounders). Patient‐control study A study that compares people with a specific disease or outcome of interest (cases) to people from the same population without that disease or outcome (controls), and which seeks to find associations between the outcome and prior exposure to particular risk factors. This design is particularly useful when the outcome is rare and when past exposure can be reliably measured. Patient‐control studies are usually but not always retrospective. Cross‐sectional study Studies in which the presence or absence of disease or other health‐related variables are determined for each member of the study population or in a representative sample at one particular time. This contrasts with cohort studies, which are followed over a period of time. Taken from the Cochrane Glossary. See Differences between protocol and review.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Children and adolescents with ADHD, with or without comorbid conditions. At least 75% of study participants were required to be aged 18 years or younger, and the mean age of the trial population had to be 18 years of age or younger. We also required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ &gt; 70 points). See Differences between protocol and review. We accepted the following diagnoses of ADHD. A diagnosis of ADHD made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) ‐ 3rd Edition (DSM‐III; APA 1980); 3rd Edition ‐ Revised (DSM‐III‐R; APA 1987); 4th Edition (DSM‐IV; APA 1994); 4th Edition ‐ Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR; APA 2000), or5th Edition (DSM‐5; APA 2013). A diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorders made in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases ‐ 9th Revision (ICD‐9; WHO 1977) and‐10th Revision (ICD‐10; WHO 1992).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation as part of any medical treatment regimen. In the comparative cohort studies and patient‐control studies, we included studies that compared cointerventions as long as the compared intervention groups received the same cointerventions. In the non‐comparative cohort studies, we allowed some types of comedication but not cointervention with another type of ADHD medication. See Differences between protocol and review.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>We defined the term 'adverse events' as any harm, adverse effect, or adverse drug reaction associated with methylphenidate. We defined 'withdrawals' as any participants withdrawn from methylphenidate medication. Primary outcomes Serious adverse events. A serious adverse event is defined as any event that is fatal; life‐threatening; requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; or results in persistent or significant disability, or any event that requires intervention to prevent any of these outcomes in accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1) (ICH 1996). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to serious adverse events. Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to adverse events of unknown severity. Secondary outcomes Non‐serious adverse events. All other adverse events, including but not confined to, the following common types of adverse events: cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, difficulty with sleep, and growth retardation in accordance with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1) (ICH 1996). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non‐serious adverse events. Withdrawal of methylphenidate for unknown reasons. Adverse events were measured during treatment, at the end of treatment and at the longest follow‐up, using rating scales, spontaneous reports recorded by the investigators at regular interviews or visits, and physical examinations or para‐clinical examinations. We reported the primary and the secondary outcomes in summary of findings Table for the main comparison. See Differences between protocol and review.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
