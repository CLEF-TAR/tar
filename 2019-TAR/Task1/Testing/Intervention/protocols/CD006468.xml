  <Objectives>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer and a CVC.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>People of any age with cancer and a CVC, with either solid or hematologic cancer, at any stage of their cancer, and irrespective of the type of cancer therapy received. Participants had to have no clinical evidence of VTE at enrolment.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Intervention: parenteral anticoagulants (including UFH, LMWH, and fondaparinux) irrespective of the dose; VKA irrespective of the dose; direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) irrespective of the dose. Control: placebo or no intervention; any of the anticoagulants listed under intervention.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes All‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes Catheter‐related thrombosis. The diagnosis of CVC thrombosis could have resulted either from screening with the described screening methods or from clinical suspicion with subsequent confirmation by one of the described tests. Non‐catheter‐related thrombosis. DVT events diagnosed using an objective diagnostic test such as: venography, 125I‐fibrinogen‐uptake test, impedance plethysmography, or compression ultrasound. PE events diagnosed using an objective diagnostic test such as: pulmonary perfusion/ventilation scan, computed tomography, pulmonary angiography, or autopsy. Major bleeding: authors' definitions of major bleeding. Minor bleeding: authors' definitions of minor bleeding. Catheter‐related infection: author's definition of catheter‐related infection. Thrombocytopenia: authors' definitions of thrombocytopenia. Health‐related quality of life (HRQoL): measured using a validated tool. Premature CVC removal. HIT. Heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT).</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
