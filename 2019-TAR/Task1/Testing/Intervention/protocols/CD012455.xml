  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess whether the quantity and quality of sleep may be improved by administration of melatonin to adults in the intensive care unit. To assess whether melatonin given for sleep promotion improves both physical and psychological patient outcomes.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐randomized controlled trials (for example, studies in which participants were assigned by alternation, date of birth, or medical record number).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included adult participants over 16 years of age who were admitted to any ICU as emergency, medical, or postoperative elective surgical patients. We did not limit types of participants by severity of the condition. We included participants who were mechanically ventilated and those who were not mechanically ventilated.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We included studies that compared the use of melatonin given at an appropriate clinical dose with the intention of promoting night‐time sleep, against: no agent; or another agent, administered specifically to promote sleep.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>We were interested in quantity and quality of sleep. The experience of sleep may not always be representative of objectively measured sleep, and given that patients perceive that they have disrupted sleep while in the ICU (Freedman 1999), we included this outcome, regardless of whether validated scales had been used for measurement. An added issue for this outcome is that critically ill patients may have limited or no ability to communicate. Therefore, we were equally interested in the perceptions of carers and family members who may have an impression of sleep from the bedside, and in subjective measures used by personnel to assess sleep. We included assessments of sleep that have been performed at the end of follow‐up, as defined by study authors, for example in the morning or during the daytime that followed administration of the intervention. We included assessments that were completed with the use of scales, whether validated or not, and modified for each user, such as the Richards‐Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (Richards 2000), or through compilation of sleep diaries, such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (Monk 1994). Study authors may use scales to determine levels of participant consciousness and we aimed to report study authors' interpretations of these scales. For example, participants may be sedated at level 3 on the Ramsay Sedation Scale (“Patient responds to commands only”) and may be in a sleep‐like state at level 4 or 5 on this scale (“Patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus” or “Patient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus”) (Ramsay Sedation Scale). We reported the quantity and quality of sleep as measured by objective equipment. In particular, polysomnography (PSG) is considered the most accurate and objective tool that can be used to measure sleep and to identify sleep disorders (Beecroft 2008). PSG measurements can be analysed to detect sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and length of sleep stages, as well as irregularities, such as apnoea and interrupted sleep. We also accepted measurements obtained when other tools had been used to record sleep activity (Beecroft 2008; Benini 2005; Elliott 2013): ‘actigraphy’ is a wristband‐style tool that measures gross motor activity and is analysed to score total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and awakenings; bispectral index (BIS) is typically used to calculate depth of anaesthesia through interpretation of an electroencephalogram (EEG) reading; and measures of EEG alone can be used to interpret electrical brain activity as sleep time. We acknowledge that collection and interpretation of data using objective tools may be problematic in people who are critically ill because manual methods have poor inter‐rater reliability (Ambrogio 2008); people who are critically ill may have various forms of encephalopathy (septic, toxic, or metabolic) or may be treated with intravenous sedatives and these factors may make interpretation of EEG readings more problematic. We used interpretations of these measurements as reported by each study author to define the quantity and quality of sleep. Our aim was to establish not only whether melatonin improves sleep but whether improvement in sleep leads to better patient outcomes. This was reflected in our secondary outcome measure, which considered potential physical and psychological consequences of sleep loss, although we acknowledge that it may not be possible to ascertain whether a reduction in such events is directly attributable to improved sleep. We assessed physical consequences of sleep loss by collecting data from studies that reported the number of participants who had had an adverse event during follow‐up time, as defined by study authors. We assessed psychological consequences of sleep loss by collecting data from studies that reported the number of participants who had been given a diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or both, by using validated assessment tools during the follow‐up period, as defined by study authors. Primary outcomes Quantity and quality of sleep as measured through reports of participants or family members or by personnel assessments. Quantity and quality of sleep as measured by PSG, actigraphy, BIS, or EEG. Secondary outcomes Anxiety or depression, or both, as measured with the use of validated tools, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond 1983). Mortality at 30 days. Length of stay in the ICU. Adverse events (such as nausea, headache, or dizziness).</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
