  <Objectives>To assess the effects of non‐pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS).</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regardless of their publication status or language of publication.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included men of all ages, regardless of social condition or ethnic origin, with CP/CPPS according with type III prostatitis of the NIH classification. If we identified studies in which only a subset of participants was relevant to this review, we included such studies if data were available separately for the relevant subset.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We investigated the following comparisons of experimental intervention versus comparator intervention. Concomitant interventions had to be the same in the experimental and comparator groups to establish fair comparisons. We performed a condition‐based comprehensive bibliographic search to find all interventions tested so far for CP/CPPS; therefore, some of them might not be listed in this section. Non‐pharmacological interventions Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Circumcision. Electromagnetic chair. Lifestyle interventions. Physical activity. Prostatic massage. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Local thermotherapy (transurethral, transrectal thermotherapy and external). Biofeedback. Myofascial trigger point release. Laser therapy. Tibial nerve stimulation. Myofascial therapy. Osteopathy. Sono‐electromagnetic therapy. Transelectrical nerve stimulation Transurethral needle ablation. Non‐intrusive ultrasound. Psychological support. Prostatic surgery. Other miscellaneous non‐pharmacological therapies. Multimodal approaches Combination of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological therapy: acupuncture plus antibiotics, local thermotherapy plus alpha‐blockers, etc. Combination of non‐pharmacological therapies. Comparator interventions Placebo or sham procedure. No treatment. Other types of interventions: pharmacological and non‐pharmacological. Comparisons We performed head‐to‐head comparisons or intervention versus placebo or sham procedure/no treatment comparisons. We did not include studies evaluating only pharmacological interventions to avoid overlapping with the review 'Pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome' (Franco 2017).</TypesofInterventions>
