  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the benefits and harms of subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) for the treatment of venous leg ulcers.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported as full text, abstract only, or unpublished data. There was no language restriction.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included studies in which participants were adults with venous leg ulcers, defined as ulcers in the lower leg or ankle due to underlying venous disease. We also included participants with venous leg ulcers that may have been complicated by other comorbidities such as diabetes. The rationale for this was to provide a result more representative of real‐patient population demographics, and ideally increase the generalisability of our review findings. We excluded participants with leg ulcers caused by other aetiologies unrelated to venous ulcers, such as arterial, diabetic, or mixed aetiologies. We included studies with mixed populations provided that separate data were available for participants with venous leg ulcers.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>The intervention was subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS), either alone or in combination with another treatment method. We accepted surgical and non‐surgical comparators, including but not limited to the following: conservative management alone (defined as compression bandaging or general wound care, or both); sham surgery (defined as a surgery that mimics the outward wound appearance of SEPS); another surgery for venous leg ulcer management that does not utilise SEPS (e.g. saphenous surgery, venous stripping); SEPS in conjunction with another surgical intervention (this was only accepted if the additional treatment method was applied to both intervention and comparator groups, that is as a co‐intervention in both groups); an alternative active intervention (e.g. debridement, zinc, mesoglycan, nutritional supplements, electromagnetic therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, topical agents). It was expected that all treatment groups would have received compression bandaging, given that this is widely recognised as routine care for venous leg ulcers (Nelson 2014). We excluded studies where SEPS in combination with another intervention was compared with a third intervention (e.g. SEPS + saphenous surgery versus conservative management), as the effects of SEPS could not be isolated.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>We did not limit study inclusion based on reporting of outcome measures. Primary outcomes Venous ulcer healing (i.e. proportion of ulcers healed within trial period, as defined by the trial authors). Time to complete healing (i.e. time from treatment commencement until ulcer resolution). Recurrence of venous ulcer (as reported in the trial). Secondary outcomes Health‐related quality of life (HRQOL), e.g. modified Skindex, Hareendran 2005, or common measures such as the 36‐item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐ 36), EQ‐5D. Adverse events (proportion of participants with any adverse event as defined by the individual trial). Serious adverse events (defined as an event resulting in hospitalisation, prolongation of hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability, a life‐threatening event, or death). Pain (as a continuous outcome, e.g. mean pain or mean change in pain, measured by visual analogue scale, numerical or categorical rating scale; or as a dichotomous outcome, e.g. proportion of participants reporting complete pain relief or proportion reporting at least 50% improvement in pain relief). No trials examined pain as an outcome measure, however we intended to also include one or more other measures of pain for the purpose of pooling data. We intended to combine overall pain with other types of pain in the following hierarchy: unspecified pain; pain at night; pain with activity; or daytime pain. Duration of hospitalisation. District nursing care requirements. We had planned to extract data at 6, 12, and 24 month time points. We had originally planned to only present 24 month data in the 'Summary of findings' tables. However, two studies only measured ulcer recurrence rate at other time points, (18 months ‐ Callini 2002), (60 months ‐ Pierik 1997), so rather than exclude these data, we included these time points in our analyses. See Differences between protocol and review'. For adverse events, we only extracted the last time point.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
