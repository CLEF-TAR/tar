  <Objectives>To assess the effectiveness and safety of the IMT in improving visual acuity and quality of life in people with late or advanced AMD.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared participants randomized to receive the IMT with participants randomized to not receive the IMT (Gupta 2014). We also considered quasi‐RCTs. In the absence of the desired types of studies, we considered including randomized within‐person study designs that compared eyes of individuals randomized to receive the IMT and fellow eyes that did not receive the IMT. For updates to this review, we will not consider within‐person studies because in practice the dominant eye is usually chosen as the eye to receive the IMT.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We planned to include trials that recruited participants with late/advanced or end‐stage bilateral wet or dry AMD. We defined late/advanced and end‐stage AMD as retinal findings of geographic atrophy or disciform scar with foveal involvement.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>The intervention was an IMT of either model, 2.2X or 3.0X. We planned to compare each model separately against no IMT.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Primary outcomes for the comparison of treatments The proportion of participants who gained 2 or more lines of best‐corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) (logMAR or equivalent) in the study eye 12 months after surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). We selected a gain of 2 or more lines as an outcome measure because it is recognized as a clinically significant important difference when assessing change in visual acuity (Beck 2007). Change in quality of life (QoL), measured as the difference in QoL scores from time of IMT implantation (or baseline) to 12 months following surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). We planned to assess QoL as a continuous variable using the Activity of Daily Living Scale Questionnaire, the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire, or any other validated QoL instrument. Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes for the comparison of treatments The proportion of participants who gained 2 or more lines of BCDVA (logMAR or equivalent) in the study eye six and 18 months after surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). Change in QoL from time of IMT implantation (or baseline) to six and 18 months following surgery (or study enrollment). Mean change in BCDVA (logMAR or equivalent) from time of IMT implantation (or baseline) to six, 12, and 18 months following surgery (or study enrollment). The proportion of participants who lost 2 or more lines of BCDVA (logMAR or equivalent) in the study eye six, 12, and 18 months after surgery (or study enrollment for control eyes). Adverse effects and surgical complications Since the IMT is implanted monocularly, the following local adverse effects and surgical complications can occur only in the eye that received the intervention. We planned to provide a narrative summary when possible for the following events in such eyes: The proportion of eyes with aborted surgery. The proportion of eyes with device explantation. The proportion of participants with BCDVA 20/200 or worse in the study eye six, 12, and 18 months after surgery. The mean endothelial cell density (ECD) loss at 12 or more months after surgery. Due to the length of the IMT, it protrudes into the anterior chamber when implanted, and implantation can lead to loss of endothelial cells and diminished ECD. These cells are essential for maintaining the clarity of the cornea. We planned to report the mean ECD loss, measured as the change in ECD from baseline to 12 months or more following surgery among eyes that receive the implant, as a proxy measure to assess risk of corneal transplant. Additional outcomes of importance to participants We planned to provide a narrative summary when possible for the following: Proportion of participants with IMT surgery who had difficulty adjusting to loss of peripheral vision in the treated eye, as reported by study participants or masked observers. Proportion of participants with IMT surgery who had postoperative pain. Healing time following IMT surgery. Proportion of participants who experienced falls.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
