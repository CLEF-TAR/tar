  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effects of blue‐light filtering IOLs compared with non‐blue‐light filtering IOLs, with respect to providing protection to macular health and function.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included RCTs in which the participants were adults (i.e., at least 18 years of age).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We included RCTs that compared a blue‐light filtering IOL with an equivalent type of non‐blue‐light filtering IOL. We did not include studies that used blue‐light filtering IOLs in combination with any other potential intervention for AMD.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes The prespecified primary outcome was the change in distance best‐corrected visual acuity (BCVA), considered as a continuous outcome, between baseline and 12 months of follow‐up. For this outcome, we accepted BCVA measures between six and 18 months of follow‐up. If studies did not report the change in distance BCVA, we utilised data reported at the end of the follow‐up period. Secondary outcomes We considered the following secondary outcomes: proportion of eyes with late‐stage AMD, being neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy as defined by the study investigators, at three years of follow‐up (with an acceptable follow‐up range of between two and four years); proportion of eyes with any stage of AMD, as defined by the study investigators, at 12 months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of between six and 18 months); proportion of eyes with a finding of pathological structural change at the macula, detected by clinical observation, optical coherence tomography (OCT) or retinal fundus photography, at 12 months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of between six and 18 months); effect on distance BCVA, measured in logMAR and considered as a dichotomous outcome (being the proportion of eyes that experienced a loss of 15 or more letters from baseline BCVA), at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); effect on contrast sensitivity function, measured in log Contrast Sensitivity (%), and considered as a continuous outcome using the mid‐range of the available spatial frequencies (between six and 12 cycles per degree), under photopic conditions, as determined by various contrast acuity charts, at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); effect on colour discrimination, measured as the proportion of eyes that had a measurable loss of colour discrimination from baseline using the Farnsworth‐Munsell 100‐hue colour test score under photopic conditions, at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); effect on average retinal macular pigment optical density (MPOD), measured as the proportion of eyes that had a significant increase in MPOD at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); effect on daytime alertness, considered as the proportion of participants who had reduced daytime alertness when measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scores, at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); effect on reaction time, as a cognitive outcome variable, considered as the proportion of participants who had reduced reaction times, at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months); proportion of people who were overall satisfied with their visual outcome at six months (with an acceptable follow‐up range of three to nine months). Adverse effects We tabulated findings relating to ocular and systemic adverse effects, as reported in the included studies.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
