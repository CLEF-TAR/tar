  <Objectives>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with stable state bronchiectasis, specifically to assess whether the use of ICS: (1) reduces the severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations; or (2) affects long‐term pulmonary function decline.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with bronchiectasis, in comparison to placebo.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Children or adults with bronchiectasis (defined clinically or radiologically) not related to cystic fibrosis.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>All types of ICS.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Change in objective measures of lung function. Secondary outcomes (A) for short‐term effectiveness (6 months or less) Mean difference in bronchiectasis severity control (wheeze, dyspnoea, cough diary, etc). Mean of respiratory exacerbations, or hospitalisations per participant, or both. Sputum volume. Mean difference in other objective indices (airway markers of inflammation, exhaled nitric oxide, etc). Mean difference in quality of life indices. Proportions experiencing adverse effects of the intervention, (e.g. pharyngeal candidiasis, voice change, pneumonia, etc). (B) for medium‐ to long‐term outcomes (greater than 6 months) Clinical indices of bronchiectasis severity control (quality of life, cough diary, Likert scale, visual analogue scale, level of interference of cough, etc). Relevant airway markers of inflammation. Proportions experiencing adverse effects of the intervention, (e.g. adrenal insufficiency, cataracts, linear growth, etc). Frequency of exacerbation per subject.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
