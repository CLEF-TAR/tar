  <Objectives>available in English Español To assess the effects of prescribed hypocaloric nutrition support in comparison with standard nutrition support for critically‐ill adults.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomized and quasi‐randomized controlled trials. We considered the inclusion of quasi‐randomized controlled trials in order to enlarge the evidence about the efficacy and safety of hypocaloric nutrition support (Schneider 2007; Shadish 2002).</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included all adult participants (aged 18 years or more) hospitalized for different diseases and severity at medical, surgical or disease‐specific (burns, trauma, neurological, etc.) intensive care units (ICUs) and requiring any type of nutrition support. Exclusion criteria: none.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>The experimental intervention evaluated was: hypocaloric nutrition support with fewer total calories than measured resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry or, if not measured, less than 25 kcal/kg/day. This could be done through restricted doses of carbohydrates or lipids, or both, with either normal or increased protein dose. The control intervention was: Normo‐ or hypercaloric nutrition support: equal to or more than the measured REE or than 25 kcal/kg/day (with the same characteristics as above); or No nutrition support at all: fasting or dextrose solutions. We evaluated the results of trials designed to compare prescribed hypocaloric enteral or parenteral nutrition support (or permissive underfeeding) with standard nutrition support, or with no nutrition, even if those trials did not reach their caloric goals in the intervention or control groups (intention‐to‐treat analysis). Furthermore, we did not include trials that planned to provide full nutrition support but resulted in unintended hypocaloric provision (for any reason).</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes The primary outcomes were the following clinical outcomes: Mortality. Death occurring during the ICU and hospital stay, or 28‐ to 30‐day all‐cause mortality. Length of stay. Days stayed in the ICU and in the hospital. Infectious complications. Events of any type of infectious complications occurring during the hospital stay, registered by the study authors according to their diagnostic criteria of infections. Secondary outcomes The secondary outcomes were one or more of the following outcomes: Length of mechanical ventilation. Days on mechanical ventilation during ICU stay. Non‐infectious complications. Events of any non‐infectious complication during the hospital stay, potentially associated with the nutrition status or the nutrition support, according the criteria of the study authors (for example: wound dehiscence, decubitus ulcers, etc.) Carbohydrate metabolic outcomes. Events of hyperglycaemia (glycaemia higher than 150 mg/dl) during ICU stay. Events of hypoglycaemia (glycaemia lower than 70 mg/dl) during ICU stay. Lipid metabolic outcomes. Events of hypertriglyceridaemia (higher than 200 mg/dl) or any lipid metabolic complication associated with the nutrition support according to the criteria of the study authors. Protein metabolic outcomes. Nitrogen balance (positive or negative in grams/day) or any protein metabolic complication associated with the nutrition support according to the criteria of the study authors. Nutrition status or clinical condition at ICU discharge. Nutrition or functional evaluation, made at the time of ICU discharge with any method of assessment used by the study authors.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
