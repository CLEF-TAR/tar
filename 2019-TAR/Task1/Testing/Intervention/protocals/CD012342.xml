  <Objectives>To determine whether a therapeutic‐only platelet transfusion policy (transfusion given when patient is bleeding) is as effective and safe as a prophylactic platelet transfusion policy (transfusion given to prevent bleeding according to a prespecified platelet threshold) in people with congenital or acquired bone marrow failure disorders</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non‐RCTs, and controlled before‐after studies (CBAs) irrespective of language or publication status. We excluded uncontrolled studies, cross‐sectional studies, and case‐control studies. We excluded cluster‐RCTs, non‐randomised cluster trials, and CBAs with fewer than two intervention sites and two control sites due to the risk of confounding.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included all people with long‐term bone marrow failure disorders that require platelet transfusions who were not being actively treated with a haematopoietic stem cell transplant or intensive chemotherapy. These disorders include myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acquired aplastic anaemia, and congenital bone marrow failure disorders. Due to the inherited nature of a number of bone marrow failure disorders, we included people of all ages, including neonates. We excluded studies of alternatives to platelet transfusion, or studies of people receiving intensive chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant, as these were the subjects of separate reviews (Crighton 2015; Desborough 2016).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Intervention Participants received transfusions of platelet concentrates, prepared either from individual units of whole blood or by apheresis to treat bleeding (therapeutic platelet transfusions). Control Participants received prophylactic platelet transfusions and therapeutic platelet transfusions. Prophylactic platelet transfusions are typically given when the platelet count falls below a given trigger level. There was no restriction on the dose, frequency, type of platelet component, or transfusion trigger of the platelet transfusions, but we also took this information into account in the analysis, where available. We included the following comparisons. Therapeutic‐only platelet transfusions (on‐demand triggered by bleeding) versus prophylactic platelet transfusions. Placebo and therapeutic‐only platelet transfusions (on‐demand triggered by bleeding) versus prophylactic platelet transfusions.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>The primary and secondary outcomes of this review were outcomes of interest and were not used as inclusion criteria for the assessment of studies. We planned to categorise all outcomes according to short‐, medium‐, and long‐term outcomes. However, we included only one RCT in the review that did not report any outcomes (NCT01615146). Primary outcomes The number of participants with at least one bleeding episode (WHO Grade 1 to 4, or WHO Grade 2 to 4) The total number of days on which bleeding occurred or the total number of bleeding episodes per participant (WHO Grade 1 to 4, or WHO Grade 2 to 4) The number of participants with at least one episode of severe or life‐threatening bleeding Time to first bleeding episode from the start of the study (WHO Grade 1 to 4, or WHO Grade 2 to 4) Secondary outcomes Mortality (all‐cause, secondary to bleeding, and secondary to infection) Number of platelet transfusions per participant and number of platelet components per participant Number of red cell transfusions per participant and number of red cell components per participant Platelet transfusion interval Proportion of participants requiring additional interventions to stop bleeding (surgical, medical (e.g. tranexamic acid), other blood products (e.g. fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen)) within 30 days from the start of the study Number of hospital admissions and length of hospital stay Quality of life assessment using validated tools Transfusion‐related adverse events (transfusion reactions, transfusion‐associated infections, development of platelet antibodies or platelet refractoriness, thromboembolic events)</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
