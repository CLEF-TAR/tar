  <Objectives>To assess the effectiveness of educational interventions for improving the complementary feeding (weaning) practices of primary caregivers of children of complementary feeding age, and related health and growth outcomes in infants.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐RCTs.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Study participants comprised caregivers of infants aged 4 to 24 months undergoing complementary feeding. Pregnant women who were expected to give birth and commence complementary feeding during the period of the study were also included. Caregivers were defined as mothers, guardians, or other family members responsible for caring for and feeding the infant.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We included studies that compared: educational intervention to no intervention or usual practice (e.g. usual weaning or child care practice); and educational interventions provided in conjunction with another intervention (e.g. provision of complementary food), so long as the educational intervention was only available in the experimental group and the adjunctive intervention was available to the control group. We defined educational interventions as comprising one or more of the following, delivered in any setting: multimedia, lectures, workshops, practical demonstrations, printed materials, skills training, counselling, campaigns, or other instructional methods (written, verbal, or audiovisual).</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Improved complementary feeding practices (measured as a continuous outcome or dichotomous outcome), of the following: age at introduction of complementary foods; duration of exclusive breastfeeding; adequacy of complementary foods (measured by number of children fed with adequate amount and consistency of complementary foods, children fed with at least five different classes of food, consisting mainly of protein, carbohydrate, vegetable, fats and oils, fruits; vitamin supplementation (for infant and mother); energy density of complementary foods; and meal frequency (number of times children are fed in a day); or based on the WHO minimum acceptable diet, minimum dietary diversity, minimum meal frequency or as assessed by study authors); and hygiene practices: safe preparation and storage of complementary foods (measured by handwashing practices (washing of caregiver's and child's hands with soap before cooking, feeding, or eating); water sanitation practices; food preparation and storage practices; serving foods immediately after preparation; using clean utensils, plates, pots, etc. for preparing or serving food and for feeding the child; and avoiding the use of feeding bottles). Adverse events (as defined by study authors). For example, overburdening of personnel delivering the intervention who were also responsible for other tasks in the health facility, stress on caregivers. Secondary outcomes Growth (measured by weight, height/length, head circumference, mid upper‐arm circumference (MUAC), weight‐for‐age (WAZ), height/length‐for‐age (H/LAZ), weight‐for‐height/length (WH/LZ) z scores, etc.) Incidence of malnutrition among participants (as defined by WHO guidelines: WHO 2013b) Morbidity (measured by episodes of diarrhoea) Mortality (indicated by all‐cause mortality, diarrhoea‐specific mortality, malnutrition‐associated mortality) Hospitalisation (indicated by the number hospitalised, length or duration of hospital stay) Change in knowledge (measured by a difference in the pre‐test (baseline) and post‐test (postintervention) results in the intervention and control arms) We presented our primary outcomes in summary of findings Table for the main comparison, and our secondary outcomes in summary of findings Table 2.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
