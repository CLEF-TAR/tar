  <Objectives>To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short‐ and long‐term mortality and morbidity. Primary comparison Any of the lower concentrations of oxygen (21%, air; &gt; 21% to 29%, very low; ≥ 30% to 39%, low) versus any of the higher concentrations of oxygen (≥ 40% to 59%, high; ≥ 60% to 100%, very high). The primary comparison was analysed by the following subgroups: targeted oxygen saturation (lower or higher limit for oxygen saturation target range for titration &lt; 85%; 85% to 90%; 91% to 95%; &gt; 95%); type of oxygen saturation monitor (fractional or functional oxygen saturation); gestation (&lt; 28 weeks; 28 weeks to 32 weeks; 33 to 36 weeks). Secondary analyses We did not include studies comparing two oxygen concentrations considered to be either in the lower or the higher ranges in the primary analyses. We planned to perform secondary analyses for studies comparing two groups that were both in the lower, or higher, oxygen concentration range (for example, 50% versus 100%).</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We considered all published and unpublished randomised or quasi‐randomised trials, including cluster‐randomised trials.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Preterm infants &lt; 37 weeks' gestation that required resuscitation at birth.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt; 0.4 or FiO2 ≥ 0.4 as initial gas mixtures) to targeted oxygen saturation during resuscitation at birth. We did not include trials comparing different O2 saturation targets. Both groups must have had the same targeted oxygen saturation. Trials were eligible for inclusion if the intervention groups shared similar oxygenation saturation targeting at any time during resuscitation or during initial neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (or both) for the first 30 minutes.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Mortality, near term corrected or at discharge (latest reported). Neurodevelopmental disability (after at least 18 months postnatal age): neurological abnormality including cerebral palsy on clinical examination, developmental delay more than two standard deviations below population mean on any standard test of development; blindness (visual acuity &lt; 6/60); deafness (any hearing impairment requiring amplification). Secondary outcomes Response to resuscitation need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) in the delivery room; need for intubation in the delivery room; time to reach desired oxygen saturation target (seconds or minutes). time to reach heart rate &gt; 100 beats per minute (bpm) (seconds or minutes). Neonatal outcomes retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (any; severe (stage ≥ 3)); intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (any; severe (stage ≥ 3)) according to Papile classification (Papile 1978); periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) (cystic); hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) Grade 1 to 3 (Sarnat 1976); necrotising enterocolitis (proven = Bell stage ≥ 2) (Bell 1978); chronic lung disease (need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life; need for supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age for infants born at or before 32 weeks' gestation); duration of respiratory support (mechanical ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)) (days from birth); duration of supplemental oxygen administration (days from birth); late mortality (after at least 18 months postnatal age); postnatal growth failure (weight &lt; 10th percentile at discharge); and duration of hospitalisation (days from birth).</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
