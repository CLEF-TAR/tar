  <Objectives>To explore the views, experiences, and behaviours of skilled birth attendants and those who support them; to identify factors that influence the delivery of intrapartum and postnatal care in low‐ and middle‐income countries; and to explore the extent to which these factors were reflected in intervention studies.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Types of studies
We included all studies that utilised qualitative methods for data collection (e.g. focus group interviews, individual interviews, observation, document analysis) and that utilised qualitative methods for data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis, framework analysis, grounded theory). We excluded studies that collected data using qualitative methods but did not perform a qualitative analysis (e.g. open‐ended survey questions where the responses are analysed using descriptive statistics). We included mixed‐methods studies where it was possible to extract findings derived from qualitative research.</TypesofStudies>

Setting
We included studies based in primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of health care in low‐ and middle‐income countries. We utilised the World Bank 2013 definition of low‐ and middle‐income countries. We chose to focus only on low‐ and middle‐income countries because these are the regions where skilled birth attendance was actively promoted by the global health community in response to high maternal mortality rates (UN 2015).
Participants
We included studies of skilled birth attendants providing intrapartum and postnatal care. We defined a skilled birth attendant as an "accredited health professional such as a midwife, doctor or nurse that is trained to proficiency and has the necessary skills to manage a normal pregnancy, childbirth and provide postnatal care as well as the skills to detect, manage and refer any complications in the mother and neonate" (WHO 2004). We also included studies of auxiliary cadres such as auxiliary nurse midwives and associate clinicians (non‐physician clinicians) where these staff were employed at the health facility, worked independently or as part of a team, and were recognised within that setting as skilled birth attendants. In some instances, we were not able to tell if health workers fit our definition of skilled birth attendants, in which case we contacted the authors of the study for more information and included these studies as long as the health workers were recognised as skilled birth attendants in that particular setting.
We also included studies that collected data from managers of health units and other providers who support skilled birth attendants as part of the team at a facility. We considered that these providers work closely with skilled birth attendants and have views and experiences of factors that influence the provision of care.
We excluded studies of student nurses' or midwives' attitudes and experiences, as we were concerned with factors affecting the delivery of care in routine settings rather than in teaching settings.
We also excluded studies that focused exclusively on traditional birth attendants, as these are outside the definition of skilled birth attendants (WHO 2008). In addition, we excluded studies that documented women's views and experiences of care, as this topic is covered in another qualitative evidence synthesis (Bohren 2014). Where eligible studies included both women's and health workers' views of care, we included these but only extracted data on health worker views.</TypesofParticipants>
