  <Objectives>The specific objectives of the review were to identify, appraise and synthesise qualitative studies exploring:
Parents' and informal caregivers' views and experiences regarding communication about childhood vaccinations and the manner in which this information is communicated; and
The influence that vaccination communication has on parents' and informal caregivers' decisions regarding childhood vaccination</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Types of studies
This is a systematic review of qualitative primary studies. Qualitative research aims to explore how people perceive and experience the world around them. Researchers typically rely on interviews, documents or observation to explore people's perspectives in connection with their health and use of healthcare services. They then explore the data by means of qualitative analytical methods and present their findings narratively rather than through numbers (Glenton 2014).
We included all studies that used qualitative methods for data collection, (e.g. focus group interviews, individual interviews, observation, document analysis) and that utilised qualitative methods for data analysis (e.g. thematic analysis, framework analysis, grounded theory). We excluded studies that collected data using qualitative methods but did not perform a qualitative analysis (e.g. open‐ended survey questions where the responses are analysed using descriptive statistics). We included mixed‐methods studies where it was possible to extract findings derived from qualitative research.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Types of participants
We included studies that focused on the views and experiences of parents and informal caregivers regarding communication of information about vaccination for children under six years of age. We defined an informal caregiver as anyone directly involved in caring for the child, making the decision to vaccinate or having the responsibility to take the child to immunisation services. The review focuses on children under six years of age because by this time children in most settings are supposed to have completed the routine vaccination calendar for childhood immunisation.
We included studies from anywhere in the world that provided information about childhood vaccinations in any setting, including health facilities, the media and Internet, communities and homes.</TypesofParticipants>
