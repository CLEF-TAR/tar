Title: Blood biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis 

Objectives: To evaluate blood biomarkers as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests to inform decisions to undertake surgery for endometriosis. Specific objectives include the following. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of peritoneal, ovarian and deep infiltrating pelvic endometriosis, compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses.
