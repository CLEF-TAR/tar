Title: The diagnostic accuracy of the GenoTypeÂ® MTBDRsl assay for the detection of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs 

Objective: 
To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for the detection of resistance to FQs in patient specimens (using direct testing) and culture isolates (using indirect testing) confirmed as TB positive.
To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for the detection of resistance to SLIDs in patient specimens (using direct testing) and culture isolates (using indirect testing) confirmed as TB positive.
To assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of MTBDRsl for the detection of XDR-TB in patient specimens (using direct testing) and culture isolates (using indirect testing) confirmed as TB positive.
