Title: Urinary biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis 

Objective: Primary 
1. To provide summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of urinary biomarkers for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis (peritoneal or ovarian or deep infiltrating, or a combination thereof) compared to surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.
2. To assess the diagnostic utility of biomarkers that could differentiate ovarian endometrioma from other ovarian masses.
Urinary biomarkers were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery as well as triage tests which would assist decision-making to undertake diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.
