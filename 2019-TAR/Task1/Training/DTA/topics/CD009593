Title: XpertÂ® MTB/RIF assay for pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults 

Objective:Since Xpert MTB/RIF can detect both TB and rifampicin resistance, we had two review questions with the following primary objectives:
Xpert MTB/RIF for TB detection
To determine summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in adults
Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection
To determine summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for detection of rifampicin resistance in adults
