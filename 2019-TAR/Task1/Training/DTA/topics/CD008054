Title: Human papillomavirus testing versus repeat cytology for triage of minor cytological cervical lesions 

Objective: For studies where both triage methods, i.e. repeat cytology and the HC2 assay, were assessed:
To assess the sensitivity and specificity of triage with HC2 and with repeat cytology to detect underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+), or grade 3 or worse (CIN3+), in women with an index smear showing ASCUS (triage group I) or LSIL (triage group II), and to compare the accuracy of both triage methods.
