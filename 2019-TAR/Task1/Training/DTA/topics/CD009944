Title: Diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the preoperative locoregional staging of primary gastric cancer 

Objective: To provide both a comprehensive overview and a quantitative analysis of the published data regarding the ability of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) to preoperatively define the locoregional disease spread (i.e., primary tumor depth (T-stage) and regional lymph node status (N-stage)) in people with primary gastric carcinoma. 
Secondary objectives
To provide the tools to calculate EUS diagnostic accuracy measures based on pre-test information, such as gastric cancer T-stage and N-stage prevalence (Bayes nomograms).
To assess whether EUS performs differently in different subgroups of patients identified by the following parameters: year of publication, country (Western versus Eastern), EUS technical features (radial versus linear array; ultrasound frequency (MHz)), definition of target condition (for N-stage: lymph node morphology versus size), gastric tumor site (any site versus cardia region only) and prevalence of target condition.
