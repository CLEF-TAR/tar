Title: First and second trimester serum tests with and without first trimester ultrasound tests for Down's syndrome screening 

Objectives: The aim of this review was to estimate and compare the accuracy of first and second trimester serum markers with and without first trimester ultrasound markers for the detection of Down’s syndrome in the antenatal period, as combinations of markers. Individual markers are described in the other reviews belonging to this suite. Accuracy is described by the proportion of fetuses with Down’s syndrome detected by screening before birth (sensitivity or detection rate) and the proportion of women with a low risk (normal) screening test result who subsequently had a baby unaffected by Down's syndrome (specificity).
