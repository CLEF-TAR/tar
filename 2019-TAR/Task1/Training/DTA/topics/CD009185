Title: Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children 

Objective:The objectives of this review were:
To determine whether any of these laboratory tests (procalcitonin, CRP, ESR) can replace (Bossuyt 2006) the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI
To assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests
To compare the performance of the three tests to each other.
