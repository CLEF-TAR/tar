Title: Computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography for detection of intracranial vascular malformations in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage 

Objective:To evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of CTA and MRA versus IADSA for the detection of intracranial vascular malformations as a cause of ICH.
Secondary objectives
To investigate the influence of the timing of the index and reference tests on diagnostic test accuracy.
Investigation of sources of heterogeneity
We planned to investigate the differences in diagnostic accuracy in subgroups defined by:
age;
ICH volume;
timing of the index test(s) after symptom onset;
CT technology (for example non-helical CT scanners, helical CT scanners, and multi-detector helical CT scanners) and MRI technology (for example MRI magnet strength and the type of angiographic technique used to image the arteries);
the coverage of the brain that is investigated by CTA/MRA in each study (e.g. some users may only evaluate the region around the haematoma while others may choose to also evaluate vessels distant from the bleed);
the number of arterial territories and orientations investigated by IADSA (e.g. the internal carotid artery territory, the external carotid artery territory, the vertebral artery territory, or all three);
whether three-dimensional angiography was used;
differences in the qualifications and experience of the radiologists reporting the index tests and reference standards.
