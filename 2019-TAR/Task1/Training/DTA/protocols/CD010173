  <objective>
To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of conventional oral examination (COE), vital rinsing, light-based detection, biomarkers and mouth self examination (MSE), used singly or in combination, for the early detection of potentially malignant disorders (PMD) or cancer of the lip and oral cavity in apparently healthy adults.
Secondary objectives
To estimate the accuracy of the different index tests with COE, when compared with each other.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included studies of cohorts of apparently healthy adults which evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the conventional oral examination (COE) used singly or in combination with an index test listed in Additional Table 1, in screening for potentially malignant disorders (PMD) and cancer of the lip or oral cavity. These included cross-sectional studies (or consecutive series) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of test accuracy. We excluded case series and case-control studies which could lead to inflated estimates of prevalence and test accuracy (Whiting 2004). We also excluded studies reported in abstract form alone, uncontrolled reports and randomised controlled trials of the effectiveness of screening programmes (intervention studies). Where randomised or paired comparative designs were available these were included in the review and analysed separately. Only studies reporting data for true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives at an individual level (as opposed to a lesion level) for each test were included. No language restrictions were imposed.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Apparently healthy adults not reporting symptoms attending an organised screening programme or screened during attendance at a dental or other clinical practice examination. We did not exclude specific subgroups of patients in this review, such as high risk cohorts or cohorts with previous suspicions on PMD or cancer of the lip or oral cavity.</participants>
  <index_tests>
The COE used as a screen, alone or in combination with any other screening tests previously listed (Additional Table 1). The COE (conventional testing test) was the initial point of the screen, which all individuals received. The index test was used as an adjunct following the COE irrespective of whether oral cancer or PMD was suspected by the COE alone (i.e. a positive test result is a positive result from either the COE or the index test or both).</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Following the consensus views of the expert working group of the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Oral Cancer and Precancer, the target conditions of the lip or oral cavity of interest are noted as.
- Carcinoma of the lip or oral cavity.
- Potentially malignant disorders.
Leukoplakia.
Erythroplakia.
Lichen planus.
Lupus erythematosus.
Submucous fibrosis.
Actinic keratosis.
Hereditary disorders such as dyskeratosis congenita or epidermolysis bullosa.</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
The reference standard was examination and clinical evaluation by a physician with specialist knowledge or training, working to the current diagnostic guidelines of their locality. At the most experienced level this would be an oral and maxillofacial pathologist or oral medicine specialist possibly utilising biopsy with histology where considered clinically appropriate. More commonly this was expected to include general dental physicians in receipt of supplementary training in the detection and identification of PMD and carcinoma of the lip or oral cavity or other physicians with dedicated training. We included studies where confirmation of individuals screened negative by the index test was done by extended follow-up. To be eligible for inclusion in the review, at least a proportion of the screened negatives were required to be verified. Where reported, for each study we noted the diagnostic protocol, guidelines or registry used for follow-up in the Characteristics of included studies table. Studies with confirmatory biopsy of individuals who screened negative by the index test were eligible for inclusion although ethically questionable (Downer 2004).</reference_standards>
