  <objective>
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of various molecular methods for the diagnosis of culture-positive bacterial and fungal sepsis in neonates and to explore heterogeneity among studies by analyzing subgroups classified by gestational age and type of sepsis onset and compare molecular tests with one another.</objective>
  <type_of_study>
We included prospective or retrospective, cohort or cross-sectional studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a molecular test in the clinical context of diagnosis of neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis. We excluded studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the test using only positive samples or healthy controls and not in the clinical context of suspected neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis.</type_of_study>
  <participants>
Neonates with clinically suspected bacterial or fungal sepsis. Clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis in neonates can be nonspecific and hence a high index of clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis. Neonates are defined as a newborn of 28 days of age or less. We defined gestational age subgroups of preterm and term infants as:
preterm: neonates born at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation;
term: neonates born at 37 completed weeks of gestation or greater.
We made a post-hoc decision to include data from studies that included infants aged more than 28 days if more than 50% of the study participants were under 28 days of age.</participants>
  <index_tests>
We defined molecular assays as any assay that involves extraction and evaluation of nucleic acid from bacteria or fungi, and performed for the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. The results of the index test were dichotomous; positive or negative. We assessed the results of the index test with the reference standard done at approximately same time. In the event of the index test identifying a different organism compared to the reference standard or identifying an organism when the reference standard was negative, we discussed among our author group as to whether we should discard or include as a false positive based on whether it was a contaminant or not. We analyzed subgroups of type of molecular assay namely broad-range conventional PCR, real-time PCR, PCR followed by post-PCR processing, multiplex PCR, staphylococcal PCR and fungal PCR. New tests/methodology may arrive in the future as the technology advances and we will address this by subgroup analyses and using year of publication as a covariate in future meta-analyses. We excluded molecular methods assessing infections other than those caused by bacteria or fungi (e.g. viruses or protozoa).</index_tests>
  <target_conditions>
Neonatal bacterial or fungal sepsis, defined as a neonate with a positive culture of bacteria or fungi from the blood or CSF, or both. We analyzed subgroups of type of sepsis onset namely early-onset sepsis (EOS) (72 hours of age or less) and LOS (greater than 72 hours of age).</target_conditions>
  <reference_standards>
The reference standard for the diagnosis of sepsis was microbial culture of blood or CSF, or both, for bacteria or fungi, or both. Microbial cultures are generally assumed to have low sensitivity but this decreased sensitivity has not been quantified. The low sensitivity of cultures in neonates may be due to the low degree of neonatal bacteremia or fungemia, small inoculation volumes in culture bottles and the use of intrapartum antibiotics. We documented the participant characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of people who were index test positive and reference standard negative to gain insight into the sensitivity of the reference standard. Alternative tests, such as evaluation of acute phase reactants or cytokines, are often used in conjunction with blood cultures but do not have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to replace microbial cultures as the reference standard.</reference_standards>
