Title: Interventions for implementation of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients at risk for venous thromboembolism 

Objective: 
The objective of this review was to assess the effects of system‐wide interventions, designed to increase the implementation of thromboprophylaxis, decrease the incidence of VTE in hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients at risk for VTE, or both, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only. We assessed effectiveness in terms of: Increase in the proportion of participants who received prophylaxis (RP) Increase in the proportion of participants who received appropriate prophylaxis (RAP) Decrease in the proportion of participants who developed any VTE (i.e. all, symptomatic, asymptomatic VTE; proximal, distal, or any DVT; PE, or fatal PE) Decrease in the proportion of participants who developed symptomatic VTE (i.e. all VTE; proximal, distal, or any DVT; PE, or fatal PE) Decrease in the proportion of participants who develop asymptomatic VTE (detected by systematic screening of participants who did not have symptoms of DVT or PE) Decrease in the number of deaths (all‐cause mortality, sudden death) Safety of the intervention (e.g. frequency of bleeding or other complications)
