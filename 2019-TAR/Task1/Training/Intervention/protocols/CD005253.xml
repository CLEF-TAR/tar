  <Objectives>To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials that dietary supplementation with iodine reduces mortality and morbidity in preterm infants.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Controlled trials using random or quasi‐random patient allocation. Cluster‐randomised trials (where the neonatal unit, rather than the individual patient, is randomised) were eligible for inclusion provided they met the other inclusion criteria.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>Preterm infants (less than 37 weeks' gestation at birth).</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>Supplementation with iodine (iodide: 30 µg/kg bodyweight per day or greater) compared with placebo or no supplementation. The comparison groups should have received the same nutrient input and other treatments apart from the level of iodide input.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Neonatal mortality and mortality prior to hospital discharge. Neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed by a validated test after 12 months' post‐term: neurological evaluations, developmental scores, and classifications of disability, including auditory and visual disability. Secondary outcomes Measures of the respiratory morbidity including: duration of mechanical ventilation; incidence of air leaks; incidence of CLD (supplemental oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age). Other neonatal morbidity including incidence of: necrotising enterocolitis (NEC); retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA); late‐onset infection. Biochemical measures of thyroid function and iodine status such as plasma levels of T4 (free and total), T3, or TSH.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
