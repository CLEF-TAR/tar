  <Objectives>To assess the effects of antistreptococcal interventions for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including multi‐arm trials.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>We included participants with clinically diagnosed acute guttate or chronic plaque psoriasis. In cases where studies only include a subset of relevant participants, we only included the study if the characteristics of participants and results were provided separately, or could be obtained through contact with authors.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>We considered any antistreptococcal antibiotic therapies, or tonsillectomy compared with placebo or no intervention, or comparisons between each other.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes Time to resolution (time between inclusion and resolution), where resolution was defined as participants achieving clear or almost clear skin (Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0 or 1; or Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90, which refers to at least 90% reduction, or PASI 100, which refers to 100% reduction in the PASI score) Proportion of participants with adverse effects, and severe adverse effects Secondary outcomes Proportion of participants achieving clear or almost clear skin (PGA 0 or 1 or PASI 90 or 100) Proportion of participants achieving PASI 75 or PGA 1 to 2 Risk of having at least one relapse at long‐term follow‐up. Timing of outcomes By short‐term, we mean within eight weeks of the start of treatment, and by long‐term, we mean at least one year after the start of treatment.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
