  <Objectives>available in English Español To evaluate the benefits and harms of first‐line RAS inhibitors compared to other first‐line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.</Objectives>
<TypesofStudies>Study design must meet the following criteria: RCTs with parallel design; double‐blind; minimum follow‐up of six months.</TypesofStudies>
<TypesofParticipants>People with primary elevated BP (that equals or exceeds 130/85 mmHg). We chose this BP threshold, lower than the standard 140/90 mmHg, to include more people and to be consistent with the recommended lower targets for people with hypertension and diabetes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.</TypesofParticipants>
<TypesofInterventions>RAS inhibitors including ACE inhibitors, ARBs or renin inhibitors: ACE inhibitors include: alacepril, altiopril, benazepril, captopril, ceronapril, cilazapril, delapril, derapril, enalapril, enalaprilat, fosinopril, idapril, imidapril, lisinopril, moexipril, moveltipril, pentopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, temocapril, trandolapril, and zofenopril. ARBs include: candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, tasosartan, telmisartan, valsartan, and KT3‐671. Renin inhibitors include: aliskiren, remikiren. Comparators Any other antihypertensive drug class including: thiazides, beta‐blockers, CCBs, alpha‐blockers, or central nervous system (CNS) active drugs.</TypesofInterventions>
<TypesofOutcomeMeasures>Primary outcomes All‐cause death. All‐cause serious morbidity (non‐fatal serious adverse events). Total CV events: fatal and non‐fatal MI; fatal and non‐fatal stroke; fatal and non‐fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations. Renal outcomes: ESRF (defined as a requirement for maintenance dialysis). Secondary outcomes Change in or end‐point systolic and diastolic BP. Change in or end‐point heart rate.</TypesofOutcomeMeasures>
