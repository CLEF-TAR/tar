## Sub-Task 1: No Boolean Search

Prior to constructing a Boolean Query researchers have to design and write a search protocol that in written and in detail defines what constitutes a relevant study for their review. In this experimental task of the TAR lab, participants are provided with the relevant pieces of a protocol, in an attempt to complete search effectively and efficiently bypassing the construction of the Boolean query.

*Input*:

For each topic participants will be provided with
- The Topic-ID
- The title of the review, written by Cochrane experts;
- A part of the protocol: The Objective
- The entire PubMED database (it can be downloaded directly from PubMED, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline).

- Other parts of the protocol, e.g. type of study, participants, index tests, target conditions, reference standards for DTA reviews, and types of studies, types of participants, types of interventions, types of outcome measures for Intervention reviews.

*Data Set*:

Participants will be provided with a test set consisting of a set of topics for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA), Intervention, Prognosis, and Qualitative reviews. They are also provided with a training set that consists of 71 DTA reviews, which were used in CLEF 2017 and 2018, and 20 Intervention reviews.
